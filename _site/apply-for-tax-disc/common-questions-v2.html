              <h2>Common questions</h2>

<div>
   <h3>What address is the tax disc and receipt sent to?</h3>
   <p>The tax disc and the receipt for payment will be sent to the registered keeper's address currently held by DVLA and should arrive in the post within 5 working days. Do not use this service if you have recently moved and you have not yet received the registration certificate in your new address.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Will I get confirmation that I have applied for a SORN?</h3>
    <p>If you make a SORN on our website, the confirmation page can be printed and used as confirmation. Also, if you provide your email address  on the website you will receive an email confirmation of the transaction. An acknowledgement letter will not be sent.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Can I change my address when using DVLA's online or telephone service?</h3>
    <p>No. You need to fill in your address details on section six of your registration certificate and send the whole registration certificate to DVLA, Swansea, SA99 1BA.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>How does DVLA check insurance, MoT certificates and GVT certificates?</h3>
    <p>When you apply for a tax disc online or by using DVLA's telephone service, the vehicle's insurance will be electronically checked with the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the <a href="http://www.mib.org.uk" title="Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB)">Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB)</a>.</p>
    <p>>MOT certificates and GVT certificates will also be checked electronically with the MoT database. Only customers with an electronic MoT certificate or GVT certificate are eligible to use this service. You can find more information about the new style MoT certificates by visiting the <a href="http://www.vosa.gov.uk" title="Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)">Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA)</a> website.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>What if I have a disability exemption certificate?</h3>
    <p>When you apply for a tax disc online or by using DVLA's telephone service DVLA is able to verify your disability exemption certificate electronically with the <a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk" >Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)</a> and the 
    <a href="http://www.veterans-uk.info">Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (SPVA)</a>.</p>            
    <p>Your vehicle must be registered in the disabled tax class. If it is not, then you cannot use the DVLA's online or phone service and you need to change your vehicle's tax class at any Post Office&reg; branch that issues tax discs or at a DVLA local office. This service cannot change your vehicle taxation class.</p>
</div>

    <h3>What is the reference number?</h3>

</div>

    <h3>Is Vehicle licensing online a secure site?</h3>
    <p>DVLA takes security very seriously.

Whenever you enter your debit card details, it is automatically protected using the SSL with 128 bit encryption.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Why is there an additional charge for using a credit card?</h3>
    <p>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is increasing the ways in which customers can pay tax. Anyone taxing online or over the phone can now pay by credit card. </p>
    <p>The charge levied by credit card companies for this facility will be passed on to the customer. Following a public consultation exercise on a number of different options, a flat rate charge for credit card payments was chosen. The &pound;2.50 charge covers the costs incurred by the Agency for providing this service. Debit card payments will remain free of charge.</p>
    <p>Other payment methods including paying by cash, cheque or debit card for Post Office&reg; and DVLA local office applicants will still be available and remain free of charge.</p>
