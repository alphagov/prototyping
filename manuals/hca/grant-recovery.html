      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>1.1.1 In defined circumstances, grant is subject to recovery. The way in which grant is recoverable is dependent upon whether the RP is an ex-Registered Social Landlord (RSL) or another type of grant-funded RP. This chapter predominantly sets out grant recovery requirements for ex-RSLs. Where RPs are referred to in the chapter, this should be read as ex-RSLs, unless otherwise stated. Other RPs should refer to their Framework Delivery Agreements for details of recovery procedures.</p>
        <p>1.1.2 This chapter sets out:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The legislative framework for grant recovery</li>
          <li>The "Relevant Events" which trigger grant recovery.</li>
          <li>The circumstances under which recoverable grant must be repaid to the Agency, or where recoverable grant can be recycled;</li>
          <li>How to calculate the amount of recoverable grant , including when property is sold</li>
          <li>How the grant is apportioned to each property within schemes developed with grant</li>
          <li>The grant recovery process, highlighting the difference between repayment and recycling through a (RCGF) Recycled Capital Grant Fund.</li>
          <li>The Permitted Uses of the (RCGF) Recycled Capital Grant Fund</li>
          <li>The requirements for accounting, reporting and audit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>1.1.3 These procedures apply to Capital Grants provided by both the Agency (and predecessor bodies) and local authorities. They apply equally to historic grant paid as Housing Association Grant or Social Housing Grant; and Social Housing Assistance (SHA) currently paid under section 19(6) of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008; unless grant was paid under contractual arrangements i.e. subject to clauses in a Grant Agreement or Framework Delivery Agreement. The different types of funding listed here are referred to collectively in the Recovery Determination and this Guide as “Capital Grant” or just "grant".</p>
        <p>1.1.4 Properties developed by organisations (who prior to 1 April 2010 were Unregistered Bodies) with the assistance of Social Housing Grant under s27A of the 1996 Housing Act, which as part of their Grant Agreement were/are subsequently transferred to RPs that were formerly Registered Social Landlords, are to be treated as funded under s18 of that Act and will therefore be subject to these procedures following transfer.</p>

    8. When a Relevant Event occurs, a Registered Social Landlord must either notify the Corporation or when a Relevant Event occurs within Greater London the GLA according to a timetable specified by the Corporation or must apply or appropriate the Capital Grant Recoverable in ways determined or directed by the Corporation.</p>
  <h3>
    PRINCIPLES FOR THE RECOVERY OF CAPITAL GRANT</h3>
  <p>
    9. Upon notification or discovery of a Relevant Event outside Greater London, the Corporation may Recover Capital Grant.&nbsp; Upon notification or discovery of a Relevant Event within Greater London, the GLA may Recover Capital Grant.<br />
    <br />
    10. When a Relevant Event occurs outside Greater London on only part of the Property or land on which Capital Grant was paid, the Corporation, may Recover a proportionate amount of Capital Grant. The Corporation may specify methods of apportionment.&nbsp; Where a Relevant Event occurs within Greater London on only part of the property or land on which Capital Grant was paid, the GLA, may Recover a proportionate amount of Capital Grant.</p>
  <h3>
    CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH REGISTERED SOCIAL LANDLORDS MAY APPLY OR APPROPRIATE CAPITAL GRANT TO SPECIFIED PURPOSES</h3>
  <p>
    11. Subject to paragraphs 16, 17 and 18 below, Registered Social Landlords may choose between repaying the Capital Grant Recoverable to the Corporation or, in relation to Greater London, to the GLA, or placing it in a fund, known as the Recycled Capital Grant Fund.<br />
    <br />
    12. Permissible uses of the Recycled Capital Grant Fund, based on policy priorities for Social Housing, will be published by the Corporation, and may be amended from time to time. These permissible uses will include those for which the Corporation would make Social Housing Grant available, unless a specific restriction is stated, and other specified purposes. The Corporation may further publish specific permissible uses for receipts generated from land or Property receiving grant through a specific funding programme.<br />
    <br />
    13. The Corporation may direct that notional interest accruing on Capital Grant in the Recycled Capital Grant Fund may also be applied or appropriated to these same purposes. The notional interest shall be calculated according to the principles in paragraph 23 below.<br />
    <br />
    14. In circumstances specified by the Corporation, a Registered Social Landlord may transfer all or part of its Recycled Capital Grant Fund to another Registered Social Landlord so that the other Registered Social Landlord may apply or appropriate it to the published permissible purposes.&nbsp; For amounts generated within Greater London, RSLs may transfer balances to other RSLs for permissible purposes for reinvestment within Greater London only.<br />
    <br />
    15. The Corporation may set time limits within which it expects a Registered Social Landlord to apply or appropriate Capital Grant to these permissible purposes. For purposes of these time limits, a transfer of Recycled Capital Grant Fund to another Registered Social Landlord will not re-start the timetable.</p>
  <h3>
    CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH REGISTERED SOCIAL LANDLORDS WOULD NORMALLY REPAY CAPITAL GRANT TO THE CORPORATION/GLA</h3>
  <p>
    16. The Corporation or, in relation to Greater London, , the GLA, will normally demand repayment of Capital Grant Recoverable, without the option of placing it in a Recycled Capital Grant Fund, when Recovery arises from any of the Relevant Events (a) to (i) in paragraph 7 above. In relation to (i) of paragraph 7, such Recovery may be deferred until the occurrence of any other Relevant Event.</p>
  <h3>
    CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION MAY WITHDRAW THE OPTION OF APPLYING OR APPROPRIATING CAPITAL GRANTS THROUGH THE RECYCLED CAPITAL GRANT FUND</h3>
  <p>
    17. The Corporation will publish, and may amend from time to time, a description of those circumstances in which the option of applying or appropriating Capital Grants though the Recycled Capital Grant Fund, established in paragraph 11 above, will be withdrawn, and repayment made in total or in part. These will relate to: risks to the contents or future contents of a Recycled Capital Grant Fund revealed by the Corporation&rsquo;s exercise of its regulatory and financial supervisory responsibilities; discovery that the administration or operation of a Recycled Capital Grant Fund, or application of its contents, has been or is in breach of the principles determined here or the requirements specified in related guidance; the breach, or expectation of a breach, of time limits for applying Recycled Capital Grant specified by the Corporation; deregistration or other specified changes of status by a Registered Social Landlord; and any other circumstances considered appropriate by the Corporation.</p>
  <h3>
    THE ADMINISTRATION OF RECYCLED CAPITAL GRANT FUNDS</h3>
  <p>
    18. Registered Social Landlords shall administer Recycled Capital Grant Funds according to the requirements which the Corporation may from time to time publish with a view to ensuring, inter alia, that the Recycled Capital Grants Fund is used to support national housing policy objectives, helps to build and maintain sustainable communities and supports regional, sub-regional and local programme priorities. Such requirements will furthermore seek to ensure that the Fund is easy to operate, transparent, accountable and promotes efficiency.</p>
  <h3>
    THE METHOD OF CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF GRANT RECOVERABLE ON RELEVANT EVENTS</h3>
  <p>
    19. The Corporation will publish, and may amend from time to time, methods for calculating the amount of Grant recoverable should the Relevant Events at paragraph 7 occur. These methods will take into account, according to the interpretation of the Corporation or, where relevant, the GLA:<br />
    <br />
    (a) for Grant paid in error or in excess of requirements, an intention to recover Grant or excess Grant in full<br />
    <br />
    (b) for disposals or other Relevant Events, an intention to recover Grant in full, but with allowance (i) for costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Registered Social Landlord in direct relation to the Relevant Event (ii) for the deferral or reduction of Grant recovered where disposal proceeds are less than the amount recoverable and (iii) for any other circumstances which the Corporation may specify in its published procedures and amend from time to time.<br />
    <br />
    20. The Corporation or , in relation to Greater London, the GLA may agree a temporary change of use, without Recovery, to one not qualifying in principle for Social Housing Grant.<br />
    <br />
    21. Where Recovery of Capital Grant calculated in accordance with the provisions of this Determination would place a Registered Social Landlord in financial difficulty, the Corporation or , in relation to Greater London, the GLA&nbsp;&nbsp; may:<br />
    <br />
    (a) defer the Recovery to a future date, or<br />
    <br />
    (b) accept Recovery by agreed instalments, or<br />
    <br />
    (c) reduce part or all of the Recovery.</p>
  <h3>
    INTEREST ON RECOVERY OF CAPITAL GRANT AND ON RECYCLED CAPITAL GRANT FUNDS</h3>
  <p>
    22. The Corporation or, in relation to Greater London, the GLA may direct a Registered Social Landlord to add interest to an amount of Capital Grant repayable upon a Relevant Event, if there is a failure or delay by the Registered Social Landlord in notification of the Relevant Event to the Corporation or, where applicable, the GLA or in grant repayment, or in other circumstances leading to a potential loss to the Corporation or, where applicable, to the GLA. The Corporation will publish, and may amend from time to time, details of these circumstances, the rates of interest to be charged, and the mechanism for its application.<br />
    <br />
    23. The Corporation or, in relation to Greater London, the GLA requires Registered Social Landlords to add notional interest to the Recycled Capital Grant Fund at rates specified by the Corporation which shall not exceed the rates which a Registered Social Landlord might reasonably expect to earn on the deposit of the cash comprising its Recycled Capital Grant Fund.<br />
    <br />
    24. When the Corporation or, in relation to Greater London, the GLA&nbsp; directs repayment of Recoverable Capital Grant placed in a Recycled Capital Grant Fund, it may direct the Registered Social Landlord to calculate and add interest attributable to the amount repaid. The interest shall be calculated according to paragraph 23 above.<br />
    THE APPROPRIATE PROPORTION OF CAPITAL GRANT DEEMED TO BE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN REGISTERED SOCIAL LANDLORDS, FOR PURPOSES OF RECOVERY<br />
    25. When land or Property on which Capital Grant has been paid becomes vested in, or is leased for a term of years to, or reverts to, another Registered Social Landlord, and a Relevant Event subsequently occurs, this Determination shall apply to the entire Capital Grant paid on the land or Property as if the Capital Grant had been made to that other Registered Social Landlord. This arrangement will also apply when one of the Registered Social Landlords is registered by the Housing Corporation and the other is registered by the National Assembly for Wales.<br />

  <h3>
    EXPLANATORY NOTES</h3>
  <p>
    Legislation provides for the Corporation to set out, in a statutory determination, the occasions when it will recover capital Grants from Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and the principles which it will apply to the recovery process.<br />
    <br />
    Where this Determination states that the Agency will publish or specify detail this will be done within the Capital Funding Guide.<br />
    <br />
    This Determination covers all property funded with housing association Grant or social housing Grant, through the Corporation or a Local Authority, from 1974 onwards.</p>

        <p>1.3.1 New to the 2011-15 Affordable Homes Programme is the concept of ‘conversions’ to aid additional supply of affordable housing. In certain conversion scenarios and as agreed with the Agency as part of an RP’s (ex-RSL's) 2011-15 Affordable Homes Programme offer, grant may not be subject to recovery provided it generates financial capacity to deliver new supply. Conversion includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On re-let, existing Social Rent to Affordable Rent</li>
          <li>Committed National Affordable Housing Programme Social Rent on completion post April 2011 to Affordable Rent</li>
          <li>Social Rent to shared ownership</li>
          <li>Intermediate Rent to shared ownership</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further details of conversion scenarios can be found in paragraph 2.13 of the 2011-15 <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/our-work/affordable-homes-framework.pdf">Affordable Homes Programme (AHP) Framework Document</a>.</p>
        <p>1.3.2 Normally in the above circumstances RPs (ex-RSLs) would be required to consider whether there may have been a <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/cfg?page_id=5718&page=130">relevant event</a> – such as a ‘change of use’ or ‘disposal ‘ and if so whether grant is due to be recycled via the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-recycled-capital-grant-fund-administration">RCGF</a>. However, where conversion has been agreed as part of the RP’s (ex-RSL's) Framework Delivery Agreement this may not lead to grant recovery and will be subject to Annex four of the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/our-work/affordable-homes-framework.pdf">2011-15 AHP Framework Document</a>.</p>

        <p>2.1.1 This section sets out the procedures that must be followed when a Relevant Event occurs in connection with grant funded land or property. Grant is recoverable when a Relevant Event occurs. Typically this is the sale of a rented property, or a shared owner staircasing, but can also be the failure to complete the development of a scheme, a change in use of a completed scheme, the sale of undeveloped land or property and other specified situations.</p>
        <p>For guidance on the term “Recoverable” follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    When this Guide uses the general term &ldquo;Recoverable&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Recovery&rdquo; it refers to the fact that an obligation arises on the RP (ex-RSL) to repay the defined amount of grant, when the Relevant Event occurs.&nbsp; This obligation can be discharged by literally repaying the grant, or by crediting the sum to the RP&rsquo;s (ex-RSL&rsquo;s) Recycled Capital Grant Fund (RCGF), if the RP (ex-RSL) is allowed to do so under these requirements.<br />
    <br />
    So, the term &quot;Recoverable&quot; simply looks at when this obligation arises and the amount of grant recoverable. It does not look at the procedural requirements governing how recycled grant can be used. These are set out in Section 5.</p>
</div>
        <p>2.1.2 The term "Relevant Event" comes from The Recovery of Capital Grants and Recycled Capital Grant Fund General Determination 2012, and must be read in this section to mean relevant events as defined in that Determination. The term does not refer to milestones, or other "relevant events" described in other guidance or contract arrangements (such as JCT contracts).</p>
        <p>2.1.3 Depending upon which Relevant Event has triggered grant recovery, RPs (ex-RSLs) will either be required to repay grant to the Agency, or will have the option of either repaying the grant to the Agency, or recycling it through their Recycled Capital Grants Fund to spend on permitted uses (see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-recycled-capital-grant-fund-administration">section 5</a>).</p>

        <p>2.2.2 When a Relevant Event occurs to land or property funded from the RCGF, the principles within the Recovery Determination (and detailed in this Guide), apply equally to the recovery and repayment or re-use of that recycled grant – as if it had been funded with new grant.</p>
        <p>2.2.3 When a Relevant Event occurs RPs (ex-RSLs) must check if it is one which requires them to repay the grant directly to the Agency, or whether they have the option of crediting the grant to their RCGF.

  <p>
    (From the Recovery Determination) &quot;Circumstances in which Registered Social Landlords would normally repay Capital Grant to The Agency<br />
    <br />
    5 The Agency will normally demand repayment of Capital Grant Recoverable, without the option of placing it in a Recycled Capital Grant Fund, when Recovery arises from any of the Relevant Events (a) to (i) in paragraph 7 above. In relation to (i) of paragraph 7, such Recovery may be deferred until the occurrence of any other Relevant Event.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    Section 7 paras a) &ndash; i) states:<br />
    <br />
    &quot;7 The Agency may exercise its powers of Recovery when the following Relevant Events occur:<br />
    <br />
    (a) When, during the progress of a project approved for Capital Grant, an instalment of Capital Grant was claimed or paid in anticipation of a Milestone, and that Milestone either does not take place or takes place later than anticipated.<br />
    <br />
    (b) When, after an instalment of Capital Grant has been advanced upon a project approved for Capital Grant, The Agency or a local authority cancels the approval, or approves the project on revised terms which involve a reduced entitlement to Capital Grant.<br />
    <br />
    (c) Discovery, upon an intermediate or final review of the costs of a project approved for Capital Grant, that an instalment or payment on account of Capital Grant had been greater than eventually required.<br />
    <br />
    (d) Failure to use Capital Grant for the purpose for which it was paid.<br />
    <br />
    (e) Failure to comply with any condition attached to the making of Capital Grant, including failure to complete a project.<br />
    <br />
    (f) Discovery that the Secretary of State, The Agency or a Local Authority has received incorrect information or made an error in connection with the calculation of Capital Grant payable or Recoverable.<br />
    <br />
    (g) Disposal of Capital Grant funded land acquired for the development of Social Housing, or designated for a further phase or phases of Social Housing, when the development or further phase or phases was, or were, not completed at the time of disposal.<br />
    <br />
    (h) Redemption of the outstanding indebtedness on a Property owned by a co-ownership (equity sharing) housing society and funded by Capital Grant.<br />
    <br />
    (i) De-registration of a Registered Social Landlord by The Agency, under section 4(2) or (4) of the Housing Act 1996.&amp;quo.;</p>
</div>
        <p>2.2.4 For Relevant Event (7)(f) – see the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-overview">Recovery Determination</a> - the Agency will make a judgement as to whether the error is of sufficient size to warrant repayment; this will normally include any sum greater than £500.

        <p>2.3.3 Where RPs fail to meet a scheme milestone by the date specified, re-forecasting is not accepted and an acceptable replacement scheme is not available, the Agency will require repayment of grant already paid under clause 7b of the Recovery Determination, (scheme cancellation).

        <p>2.4.1 Where RPs (ex-RSLs) are required to notify the Agency of a Relevant Event and that notification is not received by the appropriate deadline, as set out in paragraph 2.3.1, the Agency will normally add interest to the amount of Capital Grant recovered. For the period between the deadline (i.e. the 15th day following the Relevant Event) and the date of receipt of the notification, the Agency will normally charge interest at the same rate as for late payment of invoices, and interest will accrue daily, with six monthly compounding from the start date for payment.</p>
        <p>2.4.2 For the purposes of charging interest following delayed notification, the date of the Relevant Event will be determined by the Agency, on the basis of clause (7) of the Recovery Determination. For events (a), (d) and (e) this will normally be the date of the missed milestone or the milestone on which delivery was non-compliant. For events (b), (c) and (f) this will normally be the date at which RPs notify the Agency of the Relevant Event.</p>
        <p>2.4.3 Interest will not be charged if the Agency has been informed in writing of a likely delay and has agreed in writing that the circumstances do not justify the charging of interest for a particular period. Where Supporting Documentation is not available, RPs (ex-RSLs) can avoid interest by paying the whole of the recovered grant to the Agency.</p>
        <p>2.4.4 The Agency will charge additional interest if the invoice for repayment of grant, or interest due to late notification, is not paid within the timescales specified in the invoice.

        <p>As per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/pm-nahp-milestones">Programme Management 5.3</a> RPs (ex-RSLs) are required to notify the Agency as soon as they become aware that a forecast payment milestone will not be achieved and reforecast the milestone as appropriate. Where a reforecast is not undertaken or discussed with the Agency and the payment milestone is not actually achieved, payment of “interest only” may be due as per 2.4.6 etc below.</p>
        <p>2.4.6 Where grant is claimed and paid following a payment milestone and the Agency later discovers that the payment milestone was not actually achieved or took place later than forecast, this is a Relevant Event for grant recovery purposes. However depending on the circumstances the Agency may decide it will not recover grant but it will normally require payment of interest on the amount of that grant paid. Grant will be deemed as having been claimed in advance of the appropriate payment milestone being achieved – see Programme Management 5.2 which defines how the various payment milestones can be achieved.</p>
        <p>For some examples follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <h4>Example 1</h4>
  <p>An RP (ex-RSL) claimed grant at the forecast Start on Site milestone, but for various reasons achievement of the Start on Site did not actually occur until a later date. The delay between the forecast Start on Site date and the actual achievement of the Start on Site date came to the Agency&rsquo;s attention during a Contract Review meeting.<br />Following discussions with the RP (ex-RSL) as to why Start on Site was claimed as having been achieved and grant claimed when it hadn&rsquo;t; if the Agency considers it is satisfied with the reasons and that the scheme should continue, even though there has been a Relevant Event (milestone takes place later than anticipated) the Agency may decide that grant should not be repaid. However as the RP (ex-RSL) claimed grant in advance of the milestone actually being achieved the Agency will require the RP (ex-RSL) to pay &ldquo;interest only&rdquo; on the amount of grant already paid. &ldquo;Interest only&rdquo; will be due from the 15th day following the date the original Start on Site milestone was forecast until the day before the Start on Site milestone was actually achieved.</p>
  <h4>Example 2</h4>
  <p>An RP (ex-RSL) claims grant at the forecast Start on Site milestone but during a Programme Review meeting it comes to light that for various reasons the Start on Site is yet to be achieved. Depending on the reasons given why grant was claimed together with how soon Start on Site is likely to be achieved the Agency may agree in exceptional circumstances that the RP (ex-RSL) is not required to repay grant. However the Agency will normally require &ldquo;interest only&rdquo; to be paid on the grant which has already been claimed. &ldquo;Interest only&rdquo; will be due from the 15th day following the date the original Start on Site milestone was forecast and will continue to be charged until the date Start on Site is actually achieved.</p>
</div>
        <p>2.4.7 In such cases, "interest only" will be due from the 15th day following the date of the Relevant Event (the original payment milestone) and continue to be charged until the payment milestone is achieved or a re-forecast milestone is achieved.</p>
        <p>For some examples follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <br />
  <h4>For example 1 above</h4>
  <p>
    Original Start on Site forecast as 4.05.2010<br />
    Original Start on Site claimed as achieved on 4.05.2010<br />
    Start on Site actually achieved on 21.07.2010<br />
    Interest due from 19.05.2010 until 20.7.2010<br />
  </p>
  <h4>
    For example 2 above</h4>
  <br />
  <p>
    Original Start on Site forecast as 4.05.2010<br />
    Original Start on Site claimed as achieved on 4.05.2010<br />
    Start on Site to be reforecast<br />
    Interest due from 19.05.2010 until day before reforecast date</p>
</div>
        <p>Interest will normally be charged at the same rate as for late payment of invoices. See paragraph 2.4.1 above</p>
        <p>2.4.8 The Agency will calculate the amount of "interest only" to be paid and invoice RP (ex-RSL) accordingly. RPs (ex-RSLs) should not make a payment in advance of this invoice.</p>

        <p>3.1.1 This section sets out the basis for RPs (ex-RSL) when calculating recoverable grant following one of the Relevant Events set out in the HCA’s Grant Recovery Determination (please see 1.2.2). Where the Determination refers to the Corporation, this should be read as referring to the HCA.</p>
        <p>For details of how to apportion grant to a property in order to calculate the amount of grant that is recoverable, please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-grant-liability">section 4</a>.</p>
        <p>Please note that for schemes developed under the 2011-15 AHP, grant liability for recovery is always calculated according to the Total Grant Required (TGR) rather than the Agreed Payment Rate (APR). For details of what is meant by these terms, please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/finance-grant-claims-and-payments">Finance 3.1.6</a>.</p>
        <p>3.1.2 Where appropriate RPs (ex-RSLs) are required to calculate the Net Sales Receipt  from property sold and ascertain whether this is sufficient to cover the grant recovery liability – taking into account the HCA’s Eligible Deductions. Full details are provided in the following paragraphs.</p>
        <p>If the net receipt is greater than the recoverable grant, then the RP (ex-RSL) must either repay or recycle the full amount of recoverable grant as directed below.</p>
        <p>3.1.3 If the net receipt is less than the recoverable grant, then RPs (ex-RSLs) may need to defer recovery of the balance, or, in circumstances described in the following paragraphs, RPs (ex-RSLs) may write off the shortfall. For further guidance on writing off grant, please follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    It is a commonly held misconception that the HCA has the power to &ldquo;write off&rdquo; amounts of recoverable grant whilst that grant still &lsquo;sits&rsquo; in or is apportioned to property owned by an RP (ex-RSL). Whilst there are certain circumstances where the HCA or for amounts generated in Greater London the Greater London Authority, (GLA) may <em>waive or not pursue</em> recovery of grant, it cannot <em>write off</em> these sums. Only organisations can write off assets that are shown in their accounts. Therefore it is for RPs (ex-RSLs) to write off amounts where directed in this chapter. If RPs (ex-RSLs) are unsure about whether or not grant can be written off, they should approach the relevant Operating Area or for amounts generated in Greater London the GLA in the first instance.</p>
</div>
        <p>3.1.4 The term “recovery” is an umbrella term covering two different processes – repayment to the HCA or for amounts generated in Greater London the GLA and recycling via a Recycled Capital Grant Fund (RCGF). RPs (ex-RSLs) should note that the recycling option is only available for Relevant Events (j) to (q).</p>
        <p>3.1.5 The Relevant Events detailed in clause 7(a) to (f) of the Recovery Determination cover grant paid in error or in excess of requirements. They also cover circumstances where an RP (ex-RSL) does not act in accordance with the Grant Recovery Determination, Funding Conditions, this Guide or other published requirements. Following these Relevant Events the HCA or for amounts generated in Greater London the GLA will require the recovery of grant or excess grant (calculated by comparison of the amount advanced with the amount needed) in full, without deductions or allowances for the RP’s (ex-RSL's) costs, and, where appropriate, with interest.</p>
        <p>3.1.6 The Relevant Events detailed in clause 7(g) to (q) of the Recovery Determination cover disposals, change and cessation of use and other circumstances. Following these Relevant Events the HCA or for amounts generated in Greater London the GLA will make certain allowances, in particular for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Costs, fees and expenses incurred by the RP (ex-RSL) in direct relation to the Relevant Event;</li>
          <li>The deferral or reduction of grant recovered where Net Sales Receipts are less than the amount of grant that is, in theory, recoverable; and</li>
          <li>Deemed loan debt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.1.7 RPs (ex-RSLs) are required to keep a written record of grant recovery calculations for audit purposes.</p>
        <p>Supporting documentation should be kept together with the written record of the calculation.</p>

        <p>Discovery, upon an intermediate or final review of the costs of a project approved for Capital Grant, that an instalment or payment on account of Capital Grant had been greater than eventually required</p>
        <p>3.3.3.1 Where an approval is revised, the HCA or for grant paid in respect of schemes in Greater London the GLA will normally require repayment of any excess grant paid, that is the difference between the amount of grant paid and the revised approval plus any interest due as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-relevant-events">2.4</a>.</p>
        <h4>3.3.4 Relevant Event (d)</h4>
        <p><em>Failure to use Capital Grant for the purpose for which it was paid</em></p>
        <p>3.3.4.1 The HCA or for grant paid in respect of schemes in Greater London the GLA will normally require repayment of all grant without eligible deductions, plus any interest due as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-relevant-events">2.4</a>.</p>
        <h4>3.3.5 Relevant Event (e)</h4>
        <p><em>Failure to comply with any condition attached to the making of Capital Grant, including failure to complete a project</em></p>
        <p>3.3.5.1 The HCA or for grant paid in respect of schemes in Greater London the GLA will normally require repayment of all grant without eligible deductions, plus any interest due as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-relevant-events">2.4</a>.</p>
        <h4>3.3.6 Relevant Event (f)</h4>
        <p><em>Discovery that the Secretary of State, the Agency or a Local Authority has received incorrect information or made an error in connection with the calculation of Capital Grant payable or recoverable</em></p>
        <p>3.3.6.1 Depending on the circumstances of individual cases, the HCA or for grant paid in respect of schemes in Greater London the GLA will normally require repayment of grant in whole or in part without eligible deductions, plus any interest due as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-relevant-events">2.4</a>.</p>
        <p>3.3.6.2 If the HCA or for grant paid in respect of schemes in Greater London the GLA requires repayment of grant in part, the amount of grant to be repaid will be calculated according to the particular facts relating to the property or scheme in question.</p>
        <h4>3.3.7 Relevant Event (g)</h4>
        <p><em>Disposal of Capital Grant funded land acquired for the development of Social Housing, or designated for a further phase or phases of Social Housing, when the development or further phase or phases was, or were, not completed at the time of disposal</em></p>
        <p>3.3.7.1 Selling land that has been acquired with the aid of grant before the development has either begun or been completed requires grant to be repaid in full.</p>
        <p>3.3.7.2 The gross sales receipt for the land sold should not be less than the valuation provided to the RP (ex-RSL) by an Independent RICS accredited Qualified Valuer.</p>
        <p>3.3.7.3 Eligible deductions can be made from the gross sale receipt  as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reasonable valuation fees and expenses;</li>
          <li>Reasonable legal fees and expenses; and</li>
          <li>Reasonable marketing costs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.3.7.4 Grant paid should be recovered from the net sales receipts. That is the gross sales receipt less eligible deductions as above.</p>
        <p>3.3.7.5 Where the net sales receipt of the land/scheme being sold is not sufficient to enable all recoverable grant to be repaid (please see 3.1.3 above).</p>
        <p>3.3.7.6 Where only part of the land or scheme is sold, grant should be should be apportioned as required in <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-grant-liability">4.6</a>.</p>
        <h5>Spare Land</h5>
        <p>3.3.7.7 The sale of “Spare Land” whether sold prior to or after development is not treated as a disposal and not deemed a Relevant Event, therefore no grant is  recoverable. ‘Spare’ land includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Part of a garden or general landscaping;</li>
          <li>Plots of land for electricity sub-stations or similar utilities;</li>
          <li>Land swaps to regularise boundaries; and</li>
          <li>Rights of way, access, or easements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Spare land excludes any area of land designated at project approval for any future phase or phases of development.</p>
        <p>If RPs (ex-RSLs) are in any doubt about whether land can be classified as spare they should  approach the relevant Operating Area or in Greater London the GLA.</p>
        <h4>3.3.8 Relevant Event (h)</h4>
        <p><em>Redemption of the outstanding indebtedness on a Property owned by a co-ownership (equity sharing) housing society and funded by Capital Grant.</em></p>
        <p>3.3.8.1 The HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA will normally require repayment of all grant, without eligible deductions, plus any interest due as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-relevant-events">2.4</a>.</p>
        <h4>3.3.9 Relevant Event (i)</h4>
        <p><em>De-registration of a Registered Social Landlord by the Regulator, under section 118 or 119 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008</em></p>
        <p>3.3.9.1 When an RP (ex-RSL) seeks to de-register from the social housing Regulator all grant previously paid to the RP (ex-RSL) is required to be repaid, including credits in the RP’s (ex-RSL's) Recycled Capital Grant Fund. RPs (ex-RSLs) are required to inform the HCA immediately of their deregistration application. RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London will need to inform the GLA, and RPs (ex-RSLs) operating inside and outside London will need to inform both organisations. This is to ensure the HCA/GLA can check whether there are any incomplete schemes which may need to taken into account. Please note that where an RP (ex-RSL) holds stock both outside and inside Greater London, they will have to repay grant to the Agency for the former and the GLA for the latter. This is also the case where an RP (ex-RSL) holds RCGF generated from both inside and outside London.</p>
        <p>3.3.9.2 The HCA/GLA is aware that the act of de-registration does not necessarily mean the de-registering RP (ex-RSL) intends to dispose of its grant funded stock. The HCA or for RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London the GLA will anticipate that there might not be any immediate sales receipt from which to recover grant vested in those properties. Where RPs (ex-RSLs) are able to demonstrate to the HCA's or for RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London the GLA's satisfaction that immediate repayment of grant would result in financial hardship, the HCA or for RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London the GLA may consider agreeing deferment of repayment to a later date or repayment by instalments – please see 2.3.2.</p>
        <p>3.3.9.3 Unless, by the agreement of the HCA or for RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London the GLA, exceptional circumstances exist the HCA or for RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London the GLA will expect any sums in RPs’ (ex-RSLs') RCGFs to be repaid immediately and will arrange for RPs (ex-RSLs) to be invoiced accordingly.  Where RPs (ex-RSLs) have already entered into a written commitment to spend sums in their RCGF, they should provide full details to the Operating Area or for RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London the GLA. The HCA or for RPs (ex-RSLs) operating in Greater London the GLA will consider each case on its own merits and determine whether planned and committed spend can proceed.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <h4>3.4.1 Relevant Event (j)</h4>
        <p><em>A change of use of land or Property to one which would not qualify in principle for Social Housing Grant, or change to a use which might receive a significantly lower grant (for example a change from supported to general needs housing)</em></p>
        <h5>3.4.1.1 Change to non grant eligible use</h5>
        <p>A change of use will be a Relevant Event if the RP (ex-RSL) changes the use of the property to one which does not qualify for grant (at the time of the change of use). The Relevant Event date will be the date of the change of use.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.2 Recoverable grant should be calculated as if the property is to be sold outright.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.3 As RPs (ex-RSLs) will not actually receive any sales receipts the calculation must be based on notional figures. In order to determine the notional gross sales receipt RPs (ex-RSLs) are required to obtain a valuation of the property from an independent RICS accredited qualified valuer on the assumptions of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vacant possession; and</li>
          <li>Existing use</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eligible deductions are the same as for open sale i.e.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The deemed loan debt;</li>
          <li>Reasonable valuation fees and expenses; and</li>
          <li>Reasonable legal fees and expenses of the disposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>RPs (ex-RSLs) may not deduct any administration allowance.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.4 Grant will not normally be recoverable where the primary need of an elderly resident changes from housing to nursing care and it is intended that the next letting will be to someone in housing need.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.5 Where there is any doubt about the future use of the property, RPs (ex-RSLs) should consult the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA in advance.</p>
        <h5>3.4.1.6 Temporary change of use with permission</h5>
        <p>In exceptional circumstances, the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA may agree a temporary change of use, without recovery, to one not qualifying in principle for grant.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.7 RPs (ex-RSLs) must discuss proposals with the Operating Area or for properties in Greater London the GLA who will consider individual cases on their own merit taking into account:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The level of demand for the existing use of the land or property;</li>
          <li>The likelihood that it could be returned to Social Housing within 12 months;</li>
          <li>Factors which make it difficult or undesirable to dispose of the land or property;</li>
          <li>Whether the temporary use offers a housing or regeneration function; and</li>
          <li>Whether the temporary use falls within the permitted purposes of an RP (ex-RSL).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.1.8 The HCA's or for properties in Greater London the GLA’s agreement to a temporary change of use to one which is non grant eligible will last for 12 months. The agreement will be subject to review and only in truly exceptional circumstances renewed.</p>
        <h5>3.4.1.9 Change of use to one requiring significantly less grant</h5>
        <p>Where RPs (ex-RSLs) wish to change the use of property to one which would have required significantly less grant then an element of the original grant is required to be repaid or recycled via the RPs’ (ex-RSLs') Recycled Capital Grant Fund.</p>
        <p>Please note that this includes instances where Feed in Tariff (FIT) is claimed in respect of renewable energy generators which have also received grant funding. RPs (ex-RSLs) will have the option to recycle the grant in these circumstances, but this will need to be agreed with the relevant Operating Area or for properties in Greater London the GLA on a case by case basis.</p>
        <h5>3.4.1.10 Conversion from Social Rent to Affordable Rent</h5>
        <p>Conversions of Social Rent units to Affordable Rent units as part of a 2011-15 Affordable Housing Programme offer is not a Relevant Event for grant recovery purposes. Please see the entry on conversions at  <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-overview">1.3</a>.</p>
        <h5>3.4.1.11 Change from Supported Housing</h5>
        <p>It is not necessary to treat a change of use from Supported Housing to General Needs housing as a "notional sale". There are no gross sales receipts (real or notional) nor eligible deductions. Instead, RPs (ex-RSLs) must credit 12% of all grant paid in respect of the Supported Housing units (net of any grant previously recovered) to their RCGF, subject to the exceptions set out immediately below.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.12 If RPs (ex-RSLs) are providing a replacement Supported Housing service in units that form part of its general needs stock then grant recovery may be waived at the discretion of the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA. However the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA reserves the right to recover grant in the future, if those replacement units cease to be used for Supported Housing purposes without further replacement units being made available.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.13 Where a change of use from Supported Housing to General Needs housing triggers grant recovery, repayment or recycling of grant may be deferred until a future Relevant Event at the discretion of the Operating Area or for properties in Greater London the GLA.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.14 In considering a request to defer grant recovery the Operating Area HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA will take into account:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any changes in revenue sources and amounts;</li>
          <li>The future needs of the current client group;</li>
          <li>Changes in methods of supplying support, e.g. floating support;</li>
          <li>Other potential client groups; and</li>
          <li>The nature, type and condition of the building, currently and in future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.1.15 A change of Supported Housing client group does not constitute a Relevant Event and grant is not recoverable.</p>
        <h5>3.4.1.16 Change of use from Temporary Social Housing, Temporary Market Rent Housing, Short Life and 'HAMA PLUS'</h5>
        <p>What are</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Temporary Empty Homes;</li>
          <li>Temporary Social housing;</li>
          <li>Temporary Market Rent;</li>
          <li>Short Life; and</li>
          <li>HAMA PLUS?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Follow the link for details.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Temporary Empty Homes, Temporary Social Housing, Temporary Market Rent Housing, Short Life and &lsquo;HAMA PLUS&rsquo; are historic products which enabled certain properties to provide a limited life for social housing use. RPs (ex-RSLs) would have a legal interest in the property by means of a short lease. This could be for as little as 2 years.&nbsp; Grant was provided to make such accommodation available either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      At below market rates; or</li>
    <li>
      To provide higher quality accommodation and tenancy management than would have been available on the open market, at market rent levels.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>3.4.1.17 Where the RP’s (ex-RSL's) (short-term) legal interest in the property has run its course grant is deemed to have achieved its social policy aim and is no longer recoverable.</p>
        <p>3.4.1.18 For these products grant recovery rules are the same as for leased property funded through the Empty Homes programme. Where a lease is sold before it expires or there is a change of use to one which is not grant eligible then grant is recoverable on a pro rata basis – please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/eh-grant-recovery">Empty Homes 7.2.2</a>.</p>
        <h4>3.4.2 Relevant Event (k)</h4>
        <p><em>Cessation of use of property or land funded by Capital Grant.</em></p>
        <p>3.4.2.1 Where RPs (ex-RSLs) have ceased to use land or property for six months, for example where property has been void, the Operating Area must be notified immediately.</p>
        <p>3.4.2.2 RPs (ex-RSLs) will have one month to produce proposals for either bringing the property back into use, its demolition, or its disposal.</p>
        <p>3.4.2.3 These proposals must be discussed with the Operating Area or for land or property in Greater London the GLA and a course of action agreed. If RPs do not implement the agreed course of action within an agreed timetable, including any HCA/GLA agreed extension, the grant will be recovered in accordance with the change of use to non grant eligible procedures at paragraph 3.4.1.1 above.</p>
        <p>3.4.2.4 Where RPs (ex-RSLs) decide to cease using grant funded property grant will be recovered in accordance with 3.4.1</p>
        <h4>3.4.3 Relevant Event (l)</h4>
        <p><em>Demolition of property or other buildings funded by Capital Grant</em></p>
        <p>3.4.3.1 The HCA's or for properties in Greater London the GLA’s approval must be obtained prior to demolition of a grant funded property.</p>
        <p>3.4.3.2 If the property is be demolished because it has reached the end of its useful life (considering such factors as age, location, physical condition and property type in the context of current needs or market conditions) the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA will not normally recover grant at that time, but will consider deferring recovery to a later date.</p>
        <p>3.4.3.3 Where deferment is agreed the liability to repay or recycle grant will arise at the next Relevant Event relating to the land on which the demolished property was located. The grant recovery policy and procedures in force at that time will apply.</p>
        <p>3.4.3.4 In the meantime grant is treated as remaining or resting in the land.</p>
        <p>3.4.3.5 Where grant is resting in the land it will not be included in any value for money assessments undertaken by the HCA or in Greater London the GLA when deciding whether or not to provide additional grant to redevelop the site.  In other words, it will not make any future redevelopment scheme look artificially expensive in terms of subsidy requirements. However, both the 'dormant' and 'new' grant will be subject to future Relevant Events.</p>
        <p>For an example follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>A property is demolished and the original &pound;100,000 grant&nbsp; remains &lsquo;dormant&rsquo; in the land.&nbsp; New property is built on the site with a Total Grant Required of &pound;90,000. Some years later the property is sold on the open market when &pound;190,000 grant will be recoverable as per 3.4.4 below.</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.3.6 If RPs (ex-RSLs) demolish property so that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The resultant vacant site remains in the RP’s (ex-RSL's) ownership;</li>
          <li>The site is to be used for non-income earning purposes (such as forming an open space or facilitating the realignment of roads); and</li>
          <li>A compensation payment is received by the RP (ex-RSL).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>grant will be recovered.</p>
        <p>Where a compensation payment is received RPs (ex-RSLs) may subtract the following eligible deductions from that payment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any deemed loan debt; and</li>
          <li>Reasonable expenses incurred (excluding the costs of demolition).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If following the above eligible deductions the net payment is insufficient to enable full grant recovery, the shortfall must not be written off but must remain dormant in the land concerned until a future Relevant Event.</p>
        <h4>3.4.4 Relevant Event (m)</h4>
        <p><em>Disposal of Property or land funded by Capital Grant by a Registered Social Landlord, except</em><strong>[exceptions given in determination]</strong></p>
        <h5>3.4.4.1 Outright Sale of Land and Buildings</h5>
        <p>Follow the link for details of what is classified an "outright sale".</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>An outright sale of rental property is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A sale on the open market.</li>
    <li>A negotiated private sale. or</li>
    <li>An outright sale to a sitting tenant other than on Right to Buy/Right to Acquire/Social HomeBuy terms. &nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Outright sale excludes sales under Social HomeBuy, the Right To Acquire, the Right to Buy, and sales or transfers to other RPs (ex-RSLs).</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.2 The gross sale receipt must not be below a valid valuation by an Independent RICS Qualified Valuer.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.3 From the gross sales receipt RPs (ex-RSLs) may deduct the following eligible deductions to arrive at the net sale receipt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Deemed loan debt;</li>
          <li>Reasonable valuation fees and expenses; and</li>
          <li>Reasonable legal fees and expenses relating to the disposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.4.4 RPs (ex-RSLs) may not deduct:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any administration allowance; and</li>
          <li>The cost of demolition if the site is sold after demolition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.4.5 If the net sales receipt is less than the attributable grant, the shortfall may be written off by RPs (ex-RSLs).</p>
        <p>3.4.4.6 For additional guidance on the recording of net sales receipts from outright sales, please follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>The following information should be included in the recovery of capital grant written calculation. Please note this is not an exhaustive list and the RP should add anything else it deems pertinent:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>RP (ex-RSL) details;</li>
    <li>Property/scheme details (e.g. address, ID number);</li>
    <li>Type of sale (e.g. open market sale, Right to Buy, voluntary sale on shared ownership terms etc.);</li>
    <li>Supporting documentation for any write-off of grant (e.g. invoices, valuation report or cost floor calculation for RTB);</li>
    <li>Sales proceeds (including valuation date, duration and amount, sales completion date, discount and cost floor for RTB, and actual sales receipt);</li>
    <li>Expenses (including legal fees, RTB sales allowance/costs of abortive sales where applicable, valuation fees);</li>
    <li>Deemed loan debt (please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sp-glossary">Glossary</a> for definition);</li>
    <li>Net sales receipt;</li>
    <li>Total grant liability (please note that for schemes developed under the 2011-15 AHP this will be based on Total Grant Required &ndash; please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/finance-grant-claims-and-payments">Finance 3.1.6</a>);</li>
    <li>Grant liability minus eligible deductions as per 3.4.4.3 above; and</li>
    <li>Grant to be written off (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.7 Where grant is to be written off by RPs (ex-RSLs), supporting documentation should be attached to the written calculation to confirm the figures used in the calculation.</p>
        <p>Follow the link for further information.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>Supporting Documentation confirming the figures used in the calculation should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A copy of the valuation;</li>
    <li>A copy of the valuer&#39;s invoice;</li>
    <li>A copy of the RP&rsquo;s (ex-RSL&rsquo;s) solicitor&rsquo;s invoice;</li>
    <li>Details of the loan debt attributable to the property, and how that amount of debt was attributed;</li>
    <li>Details of the amount of grant attributed to the property, and how that amount of grant was attributed; and</li>
    <li>Scheme allocation information.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.8 Where as part of an RP’s (ex-RSL's) disposal consideration the provision of replacement property on a different site is included, the HCA or in Greater London the GLA may agree to waive recovery.  In such circumstances, RPs (ex-RSLs) must transfer the original grant liability to the replacement property and demonstrate this by means of recording a credit to and debit from the RCGF, supported by suitable documentary evidence in place of the written calculation.</p>
        <p>Any subsequent Relevant Event connected with the replacement property would lead to grant recovery under the same requirements and procedures as if the property had originally received the grant.</p>
        <h5>3.4.4.9 Sale under Compulsory Purchase Orders</h5>
        <p>If a Property owned by an RP (ex-RSL) is sold under a Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) (or where there is written evidence of the threat of a CPO), the amount of recoverable grant will be calculated in the normal way, except:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Gross Sales Receipts will be the higher of either:
            <ul>
              <li>The receipt from the disposal plus any compensation received plus any interest received as part of the CPO; or</li>
              <li>The amount obtained by a qualified valuer acting on behalf of the RP (ex-RSL) in negotiation with the body exercising compulsory powers; and</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Eligible deductions will only include the RP’s (ex-RSL's) reasonable valuation and legal fees & costs, and an administrative allowance if the body exercising the CPO has not paid them as part of the CPO process.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.4.10 The amount of interest to be included in the calculation of the gross sales received will be the interest paid by the acquiring body, less any tax on that interest that the RP (ex-RSL) may have to pay (if it is non-charitable), plus any Tax Relief Grant that it may have received to offset the tax paid.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.11 Disposal of ‘spare’ land in these circumstances is covered in paragraph 3.3.7.7.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.12 The amount of grant recovered will not normally be reduced in respect of any costs incurred by an RP (ex-RSL) in opposing a CPO.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.13 Where a reduction in recoverable grant is sought, RPs (ex-RSLs) must obtain the HCA's or for amounts generated in Greater London the GLA's prior consent, which will only be given in exceptional situations.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.14 If the net sales receipt is insufficient to enable the recovery of all grant attributable to the property or land, the amount of recoverable grant may, at the HCA's or in Greater London the GLA’s discretion, be reduced by the shortfall. RPs (ex-RSLs) must discuss such cases with the Operating Area or in Greater London the GLA. However, if RPs (ex-RSLs) make net surpluses upon the sale of other property or land within the same Compulsory Purchase Order, those surpluses must be used to offset the shortfall in whole or in part.  </p>
        <p>3.4.4.15 If a shortfall still remains, the amount of the shortfall may be written off by RPs (ex-RSLs). Where grant is to be written off, a written calculation must be supported by documentary evidence confirming the figures.</p>

        <p>Please see 3.2.3 above for information on deemed loan debt for shared ownership schemes approved on or after 1 April 1993.</p>
        <h5>3.4.4.17 Shared Ownership: Voluntary sale of rented property</h5>
        <p>RPs (ex-RSLs) should note that this section covers voluntary sales on property on a shared ownership basis with no discount. It should not be confused with Social HomeBuy (SHB), which is the voluntary sale of property outright or on a shared ownership basis with a discount funded by the HCA or in Greater London the GLA - please see the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/cfg?page_id=5539&page=73">Social HomeBuy chapter</a>.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.18 The gross sale receipt of the share being sold must not be below a valid valuation by an independent RICS qualified valuer.  </p>
        <p>3.4.4.19 RPs (ex-RSLs) may deduct the following eligible deductions from the gross sale receipt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The deemed loan debt;</li>
          <li>Valuation expenses; and</li>
          <li>Legal expenses relating to the disposal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But <strong>no</strong> administrative allowance. All grant attributable to the property is recoverable from this net sale receipt.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.20 If the net sale receipt is insufficient to enable the full recovery of the attributable grant, then recovery of the shortfall must be deferred until the next sale of further shares (staircasing).  Written calculations supported by documentary evidence of the figures used in relation to the deferment must be retained by RPs (ex-RSLs).</p>
        <p>3.4.4.21 Sales on shared ownership terms of property included in an Estates Renewal Challenge Fund Programme will be subject to grant recovery, except when such sales without recovery were agreed as part of the ERCF delivery plan.</p>
        <h5>3.4.4.22 Shared Ownership: Sale of a Property Repurchased with RCGF</h5>
        <p>Property repurchased with contributions from an RP’s (ex-RSL's) RCGF and subsequently sold on shared ownership terms are subject to the same grant recovery requirements as if the property had been repurchased with new grant.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.23 The requirements for calculating recoverable grant following a sale of a grant/RCGF funded Protected Area repurchased property,  including examples are detailed at <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/so-protected-area-repurchase">SO 9.6.2</a>.</p>
        <h5>3.4.4.24 Shared ownership: staircasing sales</h5>
        <p>The following paragraphs refer to property acquired or developed for sale on shared ownership terms, under the branding of such as Affordable Home Ownership or New Build HomeBuy.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.25 The sale of the first share in property acquired or developed for sale on shared ownership terms is not a Relevant Event and grant recovery only arises when further shares are purchased (staircasing).</p>
        <p>3.4.4.26 The gross sale receipt of the share must not be below the applicable percentage of a Valid Valuation by an Independent RICS Qualified Valuer and as detailed in the shared ownership lease. Follow the link for an example. The valuation must be paid for by the prospective purchaser.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Current property value = &pound;200K<br />
    Share to be purchased = 10%<br />
    Value of share = &pound;20K</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.27 RPs (ex-RSLs) may deduct the following eligible deductions from the gross sale receipt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The deemed loan debt attributable to the percentage of share being sold; and</li>
          <li>The staircasing allowance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.4.28 The net sale receipt is used to recover the grant attributable to the shared purchased; for an example follow the link.</p>

    The 10% Share = 25% of the original remaining shares<br />
    <br />
    Recoverable grant = 25% of &pound;40K TGR</p>
</div>
        <p>If having recovered grant attributable to the share being purchased there is still a balance of net sale receipt, then RPs (ex-RSLs) must initially use this balance to repay previously deferred recoverable grant in this or other property within the same scheme – see immediately below.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.29 If the net sales receipt is insufficient to enable the recovery of grant attributed to the share being sold RPs (ex-RSLs) should recover grant in part and the shortfall should then be recovered when the sale of a further share of that dwelling occurs, or the sale of shares of any other shared ownership property within the same scheme.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.30 Written calculations supported by documentary evidence of the figures used in relation to the calculations, deferment, tracking deferment and grant written off must be retained by RPs (ex-RSLs).

        <h5>3.4.4.32 Shared Ownership: Repossessions</h5>
        <p>For an overview of repossessions, see Mortgage Default at <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/so-after-sales">SO 7.4</a>.</p>
        <p>For further details please follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Repossession occurs where the leaseholder&rsquo;s mortgage company takes possession of the property, and then does one of three things. Either the mortgagee:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sells the lease to another purchaser;</li>
    <li>Staircases to a higher percentage (but not to 100% ownership) and sells the lease to another purchaser;&nbsp; or</li>
    <li>Staircases to 100% and then sells the property in the open market.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The mortgage company then uses the sale receipt to pay themselves the loan outstanding from the defaulting leaseholder and (in the second and third scenarios) will pay a sum to the RP (ex-RSL) as the staircasing premium.&nbsp; If there is any money left over after the loan has been paid off and the RP (ex-RSL) has been paid, the mortgage company passes it to the leaseholder. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    From the RP&rsquo;s (ex-RSL&#39;s) perspective, therefore, repossessions involving staircasing are theoretically the same as any other situation where someone staircases out, and the RP (ex-RSL) gets a capital receipt.&nbsp; However, the gross sale receipt that the RP (ex-RSL) receives from the mortgage company is not necessarily the value of the property multiplied by the RP&rsquo;s (ex-RSL&#39;s) equity share.<br />
    <br />
    The Mortgagee Protection Clause in the shared ownership lease allows the leaseholder&rsquo;s mortgagee to staircase at a lower price than that normally required.&nbsp; The amount to be paid for the outstanding share is the actual sale price of the property (not the equity percentage of a property valuation) less those sums due to the mortgagee, i.e. the sum ofthe mortgagee&rsquo;s reasonable and proper expenses incurred in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Exercising the right to purchase a new lease or the freehold;</li>
    <li>Exercising its powers of sale;</li>
    <li>The amount of principal due under the mortgage approved under Clause 34(15) (or equivalent) of the Lease;</li>
    <li>Up to18 months unpaid interest;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Advances to the RP to cover any sums such as rent and service charges due under the lease:</li>
    <li>Reasonable legal fees;</li>
    <li>Reasonable estate agent&rsquo;s fees;</li>
    <li>Reasonable valuation fees; and</li>
    <li>Other costs incurred in connection with the protection of the security or sale of the property.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.33 Policy in respect of defaulting shared owners is contained in the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/aboutus/shared-ownership-guidance-final.pdf">Shared Ownership Joint Guidance</a>.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.34 The approach to calculating recoverable grant, including deferment and potential write off is the same as for any other shared ownership staircasing (see 3.4.4.24 above), however:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>RPs (ex-RSLs) may accept (for recovery purposes) the valuation by the mortgagee’s valuer instead of one by an Independent  RICS Qualified Valuer; and</li>
          <li>The gross sale receipt is the money received from the mortgagee, as stated in the mortgagee’s statement of account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.4.35 RPs (ex-RSLs) may deduct the following eligible deductions from the gross sale receipt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The deemed loan debt attributable to the percentage sold;</li>
          <li>The <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/administrative-allowances-2011-15">Staircasing Allowance</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.4.36 Any shortfall on staircasing receipts remains a debt due to the RP (ex-RSL) by the defaulting leaseholder.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.37 Where the leaseholder’s mortgagee has used the Mortgagee Protection Clause in the shared ownership lease, and the RP has suffered a shortfall on staircasing receipts recoverable grant may be written off by the RP (ex-RSL) or deferred if the RP (ex-RSL) confirms in supporting documentation to the written calculation that they:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are in the process of obtaining legal advice, or have already obtained legal advice on prospect of recovering the money due from the leaseholder;</li>
          <li>Will take all necessary steps to recover the money due; and</li>
          <li>Undertake to credit all money received, less reasonable costs incurred, to the Recycled Capital Grant Fund, or pay the money to the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA if applicable within fourteen days of receipt.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>3.4.4.38 In deciding what action is reasonable to pursue the debt RPs (ex-RSLs) should obtain written legal advice. A copy of the solicitor’s advice must be kept with the written calculation for audit purposes.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.39 If RPs (ex-RSLs) take action as advised by their solicitor, and no receipts are generated, any expenses or abortive costs will not be allowed as eligible deductions unless the surpluses from shared ownership staircasing sales completed in the previous twelve months are insufficient to cover the costs.</p>
        <p>Where RPs (ex-RSLs) incur such a loss, they can deduct the costs incurred from a future grant recovery on a shared ownership sale or staircasing in that scheme.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.40 If the amount for which the defaulting leaseholder is liable under the Mortgagee Protection Clause would have left the RP (ex-RSL) with a surplus after full grant recovery then it is a matter for the RP (ex-RSL) to decide whether to seek to recover this amount when taking action to recover other monies due.  A worked example is given in <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/circulars">Appendix 3 of Housing Corporation Circular 26/86</a>.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.41 Where grant recovery is to be reduced or deferred, the supporting documentation should include an appropriate certification signed by the RP’s (ex-RSL's) authorised signatory together with a copy of the Completion Statement provided by the leaseholder’s mortgagee, and a copy of the mortgagee’s explanation if the sale price is lower than the Valuer’s valuation, etc.</p>
        <h5>3.4.4.42 Co-ownership equity sharing sales</h5>
        <p>When a co-ownership (equity sharing) society sells property to one of its members, the society should calculate the grant attributable to the property pro rata, based on the capital amounts of the purchasing members.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.43 The HCA or for amounts generated in Greater London the GLA does not permit deferral or write off by the RP (ex-RSL) of the recoverable grant. In other words, the amount of grant recoverable is not reduced if the sales receipt is less than the grant recoverable. There are no eligible deductions for this product.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.44 Where a case is handled solely by the co-ownership society, the recoverable grant must be repaid to the HCA or for amounts generated in Greater London the GLA.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.45 Where a case is handled through an RP (ex-RSL), that RP (ex-RSL) should credit its own RCGF with the recoverable grant.</p>
        <h5>3.4.4.46 Change of Ownership</h5>
        <p>Sales or transfers of grant funded property between RPs (ex-RSL) are not Relevant Events; grant recovery is therefore not triggered. Instead, the liability for grant passes to the recipient RPs (ex-RSLs) as if they had originally received the grant themselves. Grant becomes recoverable from the recipient RP (ex-RSL) following any future Relevant Event. See the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-overview">Recovery Determination clause (25)</a>.</p>
        <p>Both the exporting and receiving RPs (ex-RSLs) are required to keep adequate records of grant transferred to and from each other in respect of properties for future reference as this information will be required to be included in the annual RCGF End of Year Return see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-reporting-and-audit-requirements">7.2</a>.</p>
        <h5>3.4.4.47 Right To Buy</h5>
        <p>In addition to the Right to Buy provisions for local authority and former local authority tenants, prior to 15th January 1989 certain housing association tenants with secure tenancies (not assured tenancies) also had the Right to Buy under the Housing Act 1985 Right to Buy provisions. Although anticipated to be extremely rare purchase under these provisions is still possible should any existing tenants still have secure tenancies.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.48 The sale price must not be less than the Cost Floor (please see the Glossary for a definition of this term) unless the Cost Floor is greater than the Valid Valuation at the time of offer.</p>
        <p>Follow the link for an example.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    The Market Value is &pound;100K and the Cost Floor is &pound;70K. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    The Gross Sales Receipt (the sale price) is the Market Value less the applicable RTB discount, provided the discount does not reduce the sale price below &pound;70K. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    If the eligible discount is more than &pound;30K (say &pound;33K) then the sale price (and so the Gross Sale Receipt) is &pound;70K (not &pound;67K). &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    (Note the maximum RTB discount is now &pound;75K, although the figure varies by locality).</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.49 Where the Cost Floor is greater than the property’s market valuation (without discount) the sale price should equal the valuation.</p>
        <p>Follow the link for an example.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    The Market Value is &pound;100K but the Cost Floor is &pound;110K. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    The sale price, irrespective of eligible discount, is &pound;100K, which is what the tenant will have to pay.</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.50 RPs may deduct the following eligible deductions from the gross sale receipt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The deemed loan debt;</li>
          <li>Reasonable valuation expenses;</li>
          <li>Reasonable legal expenses relating to the disposal;</li>
          <li>The Right To Buy (RTB) sales allowance; and</li>
          <li>Any previous abortive RTB sales expenses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For guidance on abortive sales, follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>The cost of preparing Right to Buy &lsquo;notices&rsquo; is covered by the Right to Buy sales administration allowance.&nbsp; However, the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA may, upon request, also consider cases where an application is withdrawn before an offer notice has been served but after a considerable amount of work has been done.&nbsp; Supporting documentary evidence similar to that needed for completed sales will be required.&nbsp; Neither the Right to Buy sales allowance nor actual administrative expenses can be claimed in respect of abortive sales.</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.51 Reasonable expenses can also include deficits on Right to Buy service charges in respect of repairs (see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/circulars">circular HC18/88</a>).</p>
        <p>3.4.4.52 Abortive Right to Buy sales: A copy of the completion notice or a signed statement by the tenant that he or she does not intend to proceed with the sale should be attached to the written calculation of recoverable grant as supporting evidence.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.53 The net sales receipt must be used to recover grant attributable to the property in question. If the net sales receipt is insufficient to enable full recovery of the attributable grant, then the shortfall may be written off by the RP (ex-RSL).</p>
        <p>Why might there be a shortfall?  For some guidance follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>When RPs (ex-RSLs) sell property under <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/right-acquire">Right to Acquire</a> they receive the (discounted) payment from the tenant, and are reimbursed for the discount by claiming grant from the HCA or for properties in Greater London the GLA. RPs (ex-RSLs) therefore receive the full market value for the property.</p>
  <p>With Right to Buy sales, the discount that the tenant is entitled to is not covered by grant, and so is met by the RP (ex-RSL). It is not uncommon therefore for the capital receipt less eligible deductions to be insufficient to repay the attributable grant in full.</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.4.54 Where an RP (ex-RSL) has deducted expenses following abortive or deferred sales when calculating the net sales receipt, a schedule or similar evidence must be attached to the written calculation of recoverable grant demonstrating that surpluses from Right to Buy sales of grant funded property in the previous accounting period, and the current accounting period to date, are insufficient to cover these costs.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.55 Further grant recovery may occur if the new ‘owner’ should dispose of the property within the discount repayment period and be required to repay all or part of their discount.</p>
        <p>3.4.4.56 Grant recovery must not be deferred or written off by RPs (ex-RSLs) to give discounts to sitting tenants greater than those provided for in Section 129 of the Housing Act 1985 and/or as subsequently amended.</p>
        <h4>3.4.5 Relevant Event (n)</h4>
        <p><em>A disposal of Property or land funded by Capital Grant that would give rise to a repayment of discount under section 155 of the Housing Act 1985</em></p>
        <p>This is an historical Relevant Event, relating to the repayment of discounts repayable in a particular timeframe, which has now passed. It is not anticipated that this situation will arise in the future, and so no example has been given.</p>
        <h4>3.4.6 Relevant Event (o)</h4>
        <p><em>A disposal of Property or land funded by Capital Grant that would give rise to a repayment of discount under sections 11 and 12 of the Housing Act 1996</em></p>
        <p>This is an historical Relevant Event, relating to the repayment of discounts repayable in a particular timeframe, which has now passed. It is not anticipated that this situation will arise in the future, and so no example has been given.</p>
        <h4>3.4.7 Relevant Event (p)</h4>
        <p><em>A disposal of Property or land funded by Capital Grant that would give rise to the repayment of a payment made to a tenant as an incentive to vacate a Dwelling owned by a Registered Social Landlord under the terms of the mortgage deed requiring repayment of the original payment</em></p>
        <p>This Relevant Event relates to Tenant Incentive Schemes (TIS). These schemes had a requirement that discounts received by tenants would need to be repaid if the property was disposed of within three years of purchase. Given the length of time that has now elapsed since TIS was available, the HCA does not envisage any recovery issues arising in the future.</p>
        <h4>3.4.8 Relevant Event (q)</h4>
        <p><em>The redemption, or a disposal of Property or land funded by Capital Grant giving rise to the redemption, of an Equity Percentage Loan secured by an Equity Mortgage</em></p>
        <h5>3.4.8.1 Equity Loans paid under the former New Build Homebuy product which was available before April 2006</h5>
        <p>For a brief description of the pre-April 2006 New Build Homebuy product (which is not to be confused with New Build HomeBuy) please follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Prior to April 2006 RPs (ex-RSLs) were able to develop new-build schemes for sale and market them on the (then) Homebuy basis.<br />
    <br />
    The purchaser bought 100% of the property, but only paid the RP 75% of the market value.&nbsp; The remaining 25% of market value was treated as an equity loan provided to the purchaser by the RP (ex-RSL).<br />
    <br />
    This loan became repayable when the purchaser subsequently sold the property.&nbsp; The amount to be repaid to RPs (ex-RSLs) was 25% of the market value of property at the time of re-sale.<br />
    <br />
    RPs (ex-RSLs) received grant towards the cost of both developing the scheme as well as covering the RP&rsquo;s (ex-RSL&#39;s) costs of providing the equity loan to the purchaser.</p>
</div>
        <p>3.4.8.2 Under  the pre 2006 New Build Homebuy product, grant recovery occurred in two main stages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Initial sales stage (recovery of grant paid in respect of development); and</li>
          <li>Subsequent disposal of the property (repayment of the loan amount).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As there have been no outstanding pre 2006 New Build Homebuy schemes for some time, the HCA does not anticipate that there are any initial sales left to complete. However, if, at the time of the original sale of property, the net sales receipt was insufficient to enable grant recovery then this may have been deferred until the owner sells on and is required to repay their 25% equity loan. In this case, the deferred grant would be recovered from the 25% of the value that is payable to the RP (ex-RSL).</p>
        <p>3.4.8.3 If, on repayment of the equity loan the receipt is insufficient to recover the ‘loan’ element of grant, plus any deferred ‘development’ grant the shortfall may be written off by the RP (ex-RSL).</p>

        <p>This is because, for these products, grant is paid directly to the homeowner (in the form of a loan) and equity loans are repaid direct to Post Sales HomeBuy Agent. The home owner’s solicitor then repays 50% of the amount redeemed to the developing loan provider 50% to the HCA or for properties in London the GLA. The whole process is administered through contract, with the grant being sent to the developer and HCA/GLA via the home owner’s solicitor on the day of completion, the process for which is managed by the Post Sales HomeBuy Agent.  There is therefore no option to recycle recovered grant in respect of FirstBuy/HomeBuy Direct.</p>

        <p>4.1.1 This section sets out the requirements for apportioning grant on a reasonable basis to individual properties where a relevant event does not affect the whole scheme. It also makes reference to apportionment of grant to and within schemes in respect of the 2011-2015 Affordable Housing Programme where grant is payable on an Agreed Payment Rate per unit basis but also subject to Total Grant Required as indicated in the offer.</p>
        <p>For examples of what the Agency believes to be a reasonable basis follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Acceptable methods of grant apportionment to individual properties are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rents as charged on first letting.</li>
    <li>Floor area.</li>
    <li>Equal division where properties are similar in size.</li>

          <li>Grant paid to clear the loan on a scheme originally approved under S.41 of the Housing Associations Act 1985, and the works funded under later legislation.</li>
          <li>Grant paid for re-improvement, Major Repairs, and Minor Miscellaneous Works.</li>
          <li>Grant paid on any previous scheme on the site, which has been demolished whose recovery has been deferred (i.e. previous grant less any grant already recovered).</li>

    Shared ownership staircasing sales</h4>
  <p>
    A 25% share of a dwelling was initially purchased and the total grant attributable to the unsold equity (75%) in the property was &pound;21,000.<br />
    <br />
    The shared owner buys a further 25% of the property. This is one third of the equity owned by the RP (ex-RSL) (25% out of 75%).<br />
    <br />
    The grant attributable to that staircasing is therefore one third of the grant paid (&pound;21,000) i.e. &pound;7,000.<br />
    <br />
    Recovery of &pound;2,143 had been deferred from a previous staircasing of a different dwelling in the same scheme.<br />
    <br />
    The total grant recoverable is therefore &pound;7,000 + &pound;2,143 = &pound;9,143<br />
    <br />
    If the net sale receipt of this current staircasing is &pound;8,250 then &pound;8,250 of grant is recovered and the balance of &pound;893 (&pound;9,143 - &pound;8,250) is deferred to the next staircasing within this scheme.</p>

        <p>4.5.1 In all cases RPs (ex-RSLs) should refer back to the procedures under which these schemes were developed for the special features relating to sale and grant recovery. The special features are summarised below.</p>
        <p>4.5.2 For LSE schemes where the units were sold outright at a discounted sale price, the grant funded discount is not recoverable.</p>
        <p>4.5.3 For LSE shared ownership schemes, the recoverable grant is the total grant paid less 25% (or the specified percentage) of the cost of providing that dwelling at final cost stage. For these dwellings, Grant will never be recovered in full unless the whole dwelling is disposed of, in which case the procedures for outright sale will apply. For an example click on the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    25% of a dwelling was initially purchased, with grant attributable to the remaining 75% of the dwelling of &pound;21,000. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    If the shared owner then buys the maximum shares allowed, that is a further 50% of the dwelling, (ie two thirds of the remaining shares) the grant attributable to that staircasing is two thirds of &pound;21,000 = &pound;14,000.&nbsp; The balance of &pound;7,000 grant</p>
</div>
        <p>4.5.4 For Rural Restricted Equity and some Protected Area property, a cap is placed on the proportion of equity that the shared owner can purchase, e.g. restricting the shared owner to 80% ownership. The whole of the Capital Grant paid, or indicated as TGR on IMS in respect of 2011-2015 AHP funded schemes, on the property is recoverable, if possible, from the proceeds of that restricted staircasing.</p>
        <p>For an example, click on the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    25% of a dwelling was initially purchased and the grant attributable to the unsold equity was &pound;21,000.<br />
    <br />
    With a cap of 80% sales, that leaves 55% of the equity available to be purchased at some point (80% - 25%)<br />
    <br />
    If the shared owner buys a further 40% of the dwelling, the grant attributable to that staircasing is 40/55 x &pound;21,000 = &pound;15,273.<br />
    <br />
    If the net sale receipt is &pound;19,800 then the &pound;15,273 of grant would be recovered, with the balance of &pound;4, 527 accruing to the RP (ex-RSL).<br />
    <br />
    If the net sale receipt is &pound;9,200 then &pound;9,200 of grant will be recovered with the balance of &pound;6,527 (15,273 - &pound;9,200) of the recoverable grant would be deferred to the next staircasing sale.<br />
    <br />
    The grant attributable to the final staircasing to 80% ownership would be (&pound;21,000 - &pound;15, 273) &pound;5,727 plus the deferred &pound;6,527 = &pound;12,254. If the net sale receipt of that staircasing purchase were only &pound;12,000 then &pound;254 would be written off by the RP (ex-RSL).</p>
</div>
        <p>4.5.5 For Rural Repurchase/Protected Area Repurchase schemes, grant recovery is calculated on a unit basis rather than a scheme basis i.e. a shortfall on one dwelling in the scheme is NOT rolled forward to other dwellings in the scheme.</p>
        <p>4.5.6 When the final staircasing of such a dwelling takes place, RPs (ex-RSLs) may immediately write off any shortfall of recoverable grant; shortfalls are not deferred to the next staircasing sale within that scheme.</p>
        <p>4.5.7 However, when considering how to apportion grant between the properties in the scheme, this must be calculated in accordance with market value (as for shared ownership), and not on other bases (as rented properties can be).</p>

      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>4.6.1 When RP (ex-RSL) sells the land or buildings that make up an entire scheme no apportionment of grant is necessary, as the recoverable grant will be the entirety of the grant paid, or for 2011-15 AHP funded schemes the entirety of the grant indicated on IMS as TGR.</p>
        <p>4.6.2 However, RPs (ex-RSLs) may sell land that is a part of a grant-funded scheme under the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scenario 1. "Spare" Land that is part of a completed development.</li>
          <li>Scenario 2. Land swap or sale, using land from a completed development, to enable site assembly undertaken either by the RP or another body.</li>
          <li>Scenario 3. Land and / or part-completed properties sold or swapped prior to completion of the development.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is necessary to apportion grant to cater for these scenarios.</p>
        <h4>Spare Land - Scenario 1:</h4>
        <p>4.6.3 Grant will not be recovered when RPs (ex-RSLs) dispose of ‘spare’ land associated with a scheme. ‘Spare’ Land includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Part of a garden or general landscaping;</li>
          <li>Plots of land for electricity sub-stations or similar utilities;</li>

        <p>4.6.4 Spare Land excludes any area of land designated at scheme approval for any future phase or phases). If in doubt about whether land is spare, consult the Agency’s Operating Area.</p>
        <h4>4.6.5 Land Swaps &amp; Sales (completed developments) – Scenario 2:</h4>
        <p>Because the scheme has been completed, the grant should have already been apportioned between the properties. There will therefore be no grant apportioned to the parts of the scheme that are landscaping, roads etc. The disposal by sale or barter of this land is a Relevant Event, but the attributed grant to be recovered is £NIL.</p>
        <h4>4.6.6 Land Swaps &amp; Sales (partially completed developments or before building work starts) (Scenarios 3 &amp; 4):</h4>
        <p>If, after disposing of part of the site, or some of the partially completed dwellings, RPs (ex-RSLs) are still able to deliver the number of units housing the agreed number of people, and comply with all other Funding Conditions, then the grant can be apportioned to the properties, rather than being apportioned between land and properties. There will therefore be no grant attributed to land (as opposed to properties) and although a Relevant Event will have occurred, the amount of grant to be recovered is £NIL.</p>
        <p>4.6.7 If, after disposing of part of the site or some of the partially completed dwellings, RPs (ex-RSLs) are unable to deliver the required number of units etc, they must seek confirmation from the Agency’s Operating Area as to whether or not the Agency is willing to continue to fund the scheme.  The Agency may be willing to allow a (reduced) scheme to proceed at lower level of grant; and in respect of 2011-15 Affordable Homes Programme approved offers the Agency will consider whether the provider may be able to deliver the balance of units elsewhere.  The first scheme would be cancelled and a new scheme funded if it meets the criteria in place at that time for new schemes.</p>
        <p>4.6.8 Where the Agency cannot agree criteria as per the above paragraph the scheme may be cancelled. This would be a Relevant Event, triggering recovery (by immediate repayment) of all grant paid on the scheme, or Total Grant Required as indicated on IMS for 2011-15 AHP funded schemes.</p>
        <p>4.6.9 If the grant payable for the new scheme is less than had already been paid for the cancelled scheme, the difference will be recoverable.</p>

        <p>4.7.1 As part of the 2011-2015 contract management, the Agency anticipates that RPs (ex-RSLs) will be required to submit an annual allocation statement. This statement will detail all grant received and where it has been allocated; RPs (ex-RSLs) cannot apportion more to schemes than the Total Grant Required.

        <p>5.1.1 This section sets out how the Recycled Capital Grant Fund (RCGF) must be administered, including crediting to the fund, its use and management. From 1 April 2012, in Greater London, the administration of the RCGF for amounts generated within Greater London is the remit of the Greater London Authority (GLA).</p>
        <p>5.1.2 As indicated in paragraph 1.2.2, the principles governing grant recovery are set out in the Agency’s Recovery Determination. These principles include the establishment and use of the RCGF.</p>
        <p>5.1.3 When grant is recoverable, unless this involves conversion as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-overview">1.3.2</a>, and where RPs (ex-RSLs) have the option between repaying grant to the Agency or within Greater London to the GLA or placing it in a self-administered fund, known as the Recycled Capital Grant Fund (RCGF), it can then be spent (recycled) by RPs (ex-RSLs) on permitted uses as outlined in <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-permitted-uses">section 6</a>.</p>
        <p>5.1.4 RPs (ex-RSLs) should note that not all Relevant Events referred to in the Recovery Determination allow an option to recycle grant and the Agency or within Greater London the GLA will require grant to be repaid – please refer to <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-relevant-events">section 2</a> for more details.</p>
        <p>5.1.5 Recovoverable grant arising from Key Worker Living or Starter Homes Initiative programmes can be recycled by RPs (ex-RSLs) on local priorities.</p>
        <p>5.1.6 RPs’ (ex-RSLs') internal records must record the originating LA area in which the credit to the RCGF was generated (see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-permitted-uses">6.4.3</a>), together with details of whether this is a rural or protected area (see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-permitted-uses">6.4.4</a>).</p>

      </div>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>5.2.1 Following those Relevant Events that do not require repayment of grant (see section 2) RPs (ex-RSLs) have the option of repaying the recoverable Capital Grant to the Agency or within Greater London to the GLA, or instead crediting it to an RCGF.</p>
        <p>5.2.2 Each RP (ex-RSL) must weigh up any advantage of being able to recycle grant against the cost of setting up and administering an RCGF including the likelihood of a usable balance being built up in the fund and spent within three years.</p>
        <p>5.2.3 Where RPs (ex-RSLs) choose to maintain a RCGF it will be required to calculate the amount of recoverable grant to be credited to the fund as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-recycled-capital-grant-fund-administration">section 3</a> above. For each Relevant Event RPs (ex-RSLs) must complete, and retain, written documentation showing the calculation of the recoverable grant. This amount must be credited to the RCGF with effect from the date of the Relevant Event. The written documentation must also show whether any of the recoverable grant is to be deferred or written off by the RP (ex-RSL) in accordance with details provided in section 3, or elsewhere in this chapter.</p>
        <p>5.2.4 Where a Relevant Event occurs for a property produced with funds from the RCGF, a recovery calculation must be made in the same manner as if it had been funded with new capital grant and credited to the RCGF or paid to the Agency in accordance with the requirements and procedures applicable at that time.</p>
        <p>5.2.5 Each year, RPs (ex-RSLs) must calculate and credit notional interest to their fund – as detailed further below in this section. This notional interest becomes part of the RCGF and may only be spent on permitted uses outlined in <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-permitted-uses">section 6</a>.</p>
        <p>5.2.6 Where a property is disposed to tenants under <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/social-homebuy">Social HomeBuy</a> or <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/right-acquire">Right To Acquire</a> procedures, the proceeds must be credited to the Disposal Proceeds Fund (DPF), not the RCGF. DPF is the remit of the Regulator; please see the <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120514075635/http://www.tenantservicesauthority.org/server/show/nav.14481">Agency's website</a> for further information on DPF.</p>
        <p>5.2.7 Where credits arise from Relevant Events relating to Affordable Rent property, these credits should be ‘ring fenced’ within RPs’ (ex-RSLs') RCGF to be spent on the further supply of Affordable Rent properties – see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-permitted-uses">section 6.2</a>.</p>
        <p>5.2.8 From 01 April 2012, where credits are generated in Greater London, they must be spent in Greater London. Similarly, RCGF credits generated outside Greater London must be spent outside Greater London – see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-permitted-uses">6.3</a>.</p>

      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>5.3.1 In allowing RPs (ex-RSLs) to maintain and administer a RCGF the Agency or in respect of amounts generated within Greater London the GLA expects the fund to be robustly managed. Credits to the fund must be closely monitored, spend planned, and the fund regularly reviewed to guard against large sums of uncommitted amounts accumulating. RPs (ex-RSLs) that are subject to an FDA should expect that their review meetings will in part be used to monitor RCGF spend. For more information on review meetings, please see Programme Management 2.3.1. Whilst the Agency and within Greater London the GLA acknowledges that it will be desirable to allow useable amounts to accrue this must be balanced against being able to spend those amounts within the prescribed time scale of 3 years – see below for further information.</p>
        <p>5.3.2 Circumstances Leading to Repayment of Grant Held in an RCGF</p>
        <p>Under certain circumstances the Agency or in respect of amounts generated within Greater London the GLA will require repayment in total or in part of any current balance in the RCGF. These circumstances are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a) The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA discovers that an RP (ex-RSL) has provided incorrect information or made a material error (defined as including any sum greater than £500) in the calculation of its RCGF.</li>
          <li>b) The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA learns that an RP (ex-RSL) has not applied all or part of its RCGF to a permitted use within three years.</li>
          <li>c) The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA discovers that an RP (ex-RSL) has failed to administer its RCGF according to the principles set out in the Recovery Determination and detailed in this Guide or has failed to report or supply information on the amounts of grant in its RCGF to timetables established by the Agency and within Greater London the GLA (as set out in this chapter of the AHCFG).</li>
          <li>d) The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA discovers that an RP (ex-RSL) has applied its RCGF for purposes other than those in the Determination and detailed in this guide.</li>
          <li>e) The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA decides, in exercise of its responsibilities, that an RP's (ex-RSL's) financial or management circumstances are such that grant held in an RCGF is at risk and/or the option of placing recovered grant into an RCGF in the future would put that grant at risk.</li>
          <li>f) The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA decides that an RP (ex-RSL) is unlikely to be able to apply all or part of its RCGF to a permitted use within three years.</li>
          <li>g) The Regulator de-registers an RP (ex-RSL) under section 118 or 119 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008. However the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA may consider allowing recovery to be deferred until a further Relevant Event occurs, using the definition of Relevant Events current at that future time.</li>
          <li>h) The RP (ex-RSL) coming under Regulatory supervision and the Regulator deciding that retention of RCGF monies by the RP (ex-RSL) would be inappropriate. The Regulator may change this decision at any time after the RP (ex-RSL) ceases to be a supervision case. The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA will not return any previous RCGF balance or recovered grant that had been paid during the period of supervision to the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London to the GLA.</li>
          <li>i) From determination</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5.3.3 For (a) and (b) the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA will require repayment of the specific sum involved.</p>
        <p>5.3.4 For (c) to (i) the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA will require repayment of all or part of the current balance (and for (c) and (d) additionally any grant from the RCGF already spent by the RP (ex-RSL) using processes or for purposes which do not comply with those set out in the Recovery Determination and this guide (AHCFG).</p>
        <p>5.3.5 The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA may also direct that grant recoverable upon future Relevant Events is repaid to the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA without the option for recycling for as long as the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA considers appropriate.</p>
        <p>5.3.6 In all cases notional interest that was added to the sum in the RCGF to be repaid will also be recovered</p>
        <p>5.3.7 In addition to the circumstances listed above, the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA may withdraw an RP’s (ex-RSLs') option of maintaining an RCGF in accordance with the principles of the Determination at paragraph 17, if it considers that it would be appropriate to do so in the circumstances of a particular case.</p>
        <p>5.3.8 Where repayment of monies previously credited to an RCGF is required, the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA will issue an explanatory letter and invoice, including the payment schedule and terms.</p>

      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>5.4.1 If wishing to recycle recoverable grant, RPs (ex-RSLs) must maintain a designated fund within their accounts entitled ‘Recycled Capital Grant Fund’. This fund must be kept entirely separate from the Disposal Proceeds Fund. There is no requirement to maintain a separate bank account for this fund.</p>
        <p>5.4.2 The fund must be supported by a robust audit trail of relevant paperwork detailing individual amounts of:</p>

      </div>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>5.5.1 Properties developed or repaired with RCGF will be subject to the same regulatory requirements as those funded with new grant from the Agency or within Greater London the GLA.</p>
        <p>Where properties funded through RCGF are defined as Social Housing under sections 68-70 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, they will become or remain subject to the regulatory standards.</p>
        <p>Withdrawals should be debited on the date of the Start on Site and/ or other payment milestones. Please note that these may differ depending on the scheme type and whether the scheme is being developed under the 2011-15 AHP or the 2008-11 NAHP. For details on Payment Milestones, please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/pm-nahp-milestones">Programme Management section 5</a>.</p>
        <p>Expenditure from the fund should be debited on a first in, first out basis. Please see 5.9.3 below for an example of this.</p>
        <h4>5.5.2 RCGF Levels</h4>
        <p>When developing property with RCGF the RP (ex-RSL) can choose how much RCGF to use up to a defined maximum amount. For comment on why the RP (ex-RSL) may choose to use less than the maximum, please follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    RPs (ex-RSLs) may choose to develop property using less than the maximum permitted RCGF contribution if they are also bidding for grant towards the scheme. As value for money, during the bidding process, scores all forms of subsidy contributing towards the cost of the scheme, the RP (ex-RSL) may wish to make their bid more attractive to the Agency or within Greater London to the GLA by using less than the maximum RCGF.</p>
</div>
        <p>5.5.3 The maximum amount of RCGF that can be used on the scheme is calculated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Total capital costs of the scheme (i.e. the amount capitalised on the balance sheet) less</li>
          <li>The sum of any sales receipts (if applicable) less</li>
          <li>The Notional Loan Debt that the RP (ex-RSL) is able to support from the rental stream produced by the properties (if applicable) less</li>
          <li>Any other resources, including the RP's (ex-RSL's) own.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>5.5.4 Repurchased units</h4>
        <p>Where an RP (ex-RSL) opts to repurchase properties where 100% has been sold in accordance with the Requirements of 6.1.3 (and this offers value for money and fit with local investment priorities) this must be funded from their own resources and where necessary RCGF.</p>
        <p>5.5.5 The RP (ex-RSL) will be able to make use of capitalised rental income from the newly created rental unit. The RP (ex-RSL) may therefore debit from its RCGF an amount up to the purchase price minus an amount equal to the capitalised rental income and plus an allowance for administrative expenses (use the staircasing sales allowance current on the date of completion of the repurchase).</p>
        <h4>5.5.6 Approval and accounting</h4>
        <p>The Agency’s or within Greater London the GLA’s prior written approval is not necessary for the use of the fund or the calculation of the amount to be withdrawn from the RCGF, unless specified elsewhere. For further guidance please follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Until the GLA undertakes to make a specific Determination for the operation of RCGF within Greater London, the operation of the RCGF remains unchanged except for the following points:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Approval of 3 year old roll over requests within Greater London will be decided by the GLA;</li>
    <li>Amounts generated as a result of relevant events within Greater London, will be ring fenced for expenditure within Greater London; and</li>
    <li>The recovery of amounts generated within Greater London will be undertaken by the GLA.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>5.5.7 The RP (ex-RSL) can choose whether to debit the full amount of RCGF to be used on the scheme at the first payment milestone (such as Start on Site), or to debit the amounts in a way which matches grant claims.</p>

        <h3><a href="#" class="closed"><span>5.6</span> Addition of Notional Interest</a></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>5.6.1 At 31 March each year, RPs (ex-RSLs) must add notional interest to their RCGF.</p>
        <p>5.6.2 While the RCGF balance is £250,000 or less, the notional rate that the RP (ex-RSL) must use is that which an RP (ex-RSL) would obtain by placing the money in the high interest deposit account operated by its own clearing bank. Therefore an RP (ex-RSL) should keep a record of these rates available for its auditor.</p>
        <p>5.6.3 While the RCGF balance is greater than £250,000, the notional rate is linked to the Bank of England’s (BOE) base lending rate, as follows:</p>
        <p>Size of RCGF Rate of notional interest calculations.<br />
        £250,001 to £500,000 Base lending rate minus 75 basis points<br />
        £500,001 to £750,000 Base lending rate minus 50 basis points<br />
        £750,001 to £1,000,000 Base lending rate minus 25 basis points<br />
        Over £1,000,000 Base lending rate</p>
        <p>A floor of 0% is applicable to notional interest calculations. Therefore, if the BOE base rate is at such a level as to produce a nil or negative amount of notional interest, then no interest should be added for the relevant period.</p>
        <p>5.6.4 RPs (ex-RSL) must calculate notional interest on a daily basis, to take account of varying balances, according to a 365 day year convention, that is:</p>
        <p>Balance x rate x (days for which this balance held/365)</p>
        <p>The base rate used in the calculation must be amended in line with clearing bank or BOE rate changes.</p>
        <p>5.6.5 RPs (ex-RSLs) who pay Corporation Tax on their RCGF interest earnings may deduct that tax from their RCGF balance at the standard Corporation Tax rate applying.</p>
        <p>5.6.6 In the calculation, notional interest must be compounded at 31 March of each year. The RP (ex-RSL) must clearly identify whether RCGF credits are recovered grant or notional interest. However, when using RCGF funds, the RP (ex-RSL) will simply be drawing against the balance on the account, and does not need to identify whether it is using money that was recovered grant or notional interest.</p>
        <p>The method for doing this is the same as for DPF. For a worked example, refer to the <a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120514075635/http://www.tenantservicesauthority.org/server/show/ConWebDoc.10283">Regulator's guidance on DPF, paragraph 2.5.6</a>.</p>
        <p>5.6.7 In calculating notional interest, the date the interest should be calculated from should be the date the recovered grant must be credited to the RCGF, i.e. the date of the Relevant Event.</p>
        <p>5.6.8 Where one RP (ex-RSL) is transferring all or some of its RCGF balance to another RP (ex-RSL) (for details of the circumstances under which this is acceptable, please see 5.10), notional interest is added at the end of the year. The transferring organisation will calculate interest on the balance up to the date of the transfer debit; the receiving organisation from the date of the credit.</p>
        <p>5.6.9 All such transfers must be recorded as withdrawals and inputs from/to the relevant RP's (ex-RSL's) RCGF.</p>

        <p>5.7.1 RPs (ex-RSLs) may, in the circumstances defined below, transfer all or some of their RCGF to other RPs (ex-RSLs), where this helps create a usable balance and/or supports the quick and efficient use of RCGF to meet local priorities. This includes Flexible Tenure, under the terms defined in <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-permitted-uses">Grant Recovery 6.5</a>.</p>
        <p>5.7.2 Transfers may occur between RPs (ex-RSLs) which are:</p>

          <li>Members of a group structure (although each member of the group must have its own RCGF);</li>
          <li>Members of a Development Partnership or Consortium which is currently in receipt of grant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5.7.3 Transfers may also occur subject to the Agency’s prior agreement  (this will be the Operating Area responsible for the transferring association) or in respect of amounts generated within Greater London the GLA’s prior approval where these are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To another local association and or,</li>
          <li>To a similar type of association (e.g. a housing co-operative)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From 1 April 2012, RCGF generated in Greater London must only be spent within Greater London, and RCGF generated outside Greater London must not be spent in Greater London.</p>
        <p>5.7.4 The receiving organisation must ensure:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It documents the transfer;</li>
          <li>It receives notification of the date on which each sum being transferred was originally credited to the transferor’s RCGF;</li>
          <li>The date on which it credits its own RCGF is no more than one day after the date the sums are debited from the transferor’s RCGF.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5.7.5 The donating organisation must debit the sum from its own RCGF on the date the amount is transferred and document this accordingly.</p>
        <p>5.7.6 Transfer of sums between organisations’ RCGF does not reset the three year repayment schedule. The time limit for spending transferred recoverable grant remains within three years following the year in which the date of the original Relevant Event occurred.</p>
        <p>5.7.7 Transfers to and from other RPs (ex-RSLs) must be separately accounted for in the Annual End of Year Returns, to avoid the possibility of double counting withdrawals and inputs. Please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-reporting-and-audit-requirements">7.2</a>.</p>
        <p>5.7.8 Where a transfer of engagements has occured the process described above should be used, with a transfer of the full RCGF balance to the receiving RP (ex-RSL). At 31 March an Annual End of Year Return should be made for both the receiving and the transferring RP (ex-RSL), (the latter covering the period to transfer).</p>

        <p>5.8.2 Whilst three years is the normal time allowed before seeking repayment of amounts in the RCGF, the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA reserves the right to collect it sooner.</p>
        <p>5.8.3 Notional interest due will be calculated by the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the by GLA, added to, and identified in the invoices sent to RPs (ex-RSLs).</p>
        <p>5.8.4 RPs (ex-RSLs) must pay the invoice by the due date, or be liable for interest for late payment.</p>
        <p>5.8.5 RPs (ex-RSLs) must not simply send payment to the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London to the GLA without having first received an invoice.</p>
        <p>5.8.6 When RCGF, plus notional interest, is repaid to the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London to the GLA the amount must be debited from the fund on the date of repayment.</p>
        <p>5.8.7 RPs (ex-RSLs) may chose to repay sums in their RCGF to the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London to the GLA at any time during the allowed three year period. Full details should be forwarded to the Agency’s Financial Assistant or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA’s Executive Director or Housing and Land and an invoice will be sent.</p>
        <p>5.8.8 On a case by case basis the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA  may allow RPs (ex-RSLs) to roll-over balances of “three year old grant” into subsequent years. The Agency or in Greater London the GLA is prepared to consider cases where it believes this is in the interest of social housing provision, or results from an acknowledged error on the part of the Agency or GLA. To seek approval of a roll-over RPs (ex-RSLs) should approach their Operating Area or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA and provide a full written explanation of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why the fund has not been spent within the permitted 3 years;</li>
          <li>Why it needs to be rolled over;</li>
          <li>What it is to be spent on; and</li>
          <li>When it will be spent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Requests will be agreed only in exceptional circumstances and at the sole discretion of the Agency.</p>
        <p>5.8.9 Requests will be agreed only in exceptional circumstances and at the sole discretion of the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London of the GLA.</p>
        <p>5.8.10 Any agreement to roll-over will initially be for only one year and will be subject to the Agency’s or in respect of amounts generated within Greater London the GLA’s monitoring. The Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA will inform RPs (ex-RSLs) of what details they should supply regarding the spend of the rolled over amount.</p>
        <p>A further roll-over is unlikely unless there are exceptional circumstances, but would necessitate a further written request by the RP (ex-RSLs) and the Agency’s or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA’s further consideration and discretion.</p>

        <h3><a href="#" class="closed"><span>5.9</span> How to identify "three year Grant"</a></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>5.9.1 RPs (ex-RSLs) must identify the amount of three year RCGF repayable, if any, while preparing their annual electronic end of year data return (see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-reporting-and-audit-requirements">section 7</a>).</p>
        <p>5.9.2 The three years starts from the end of the RCGF year (31st March) in which the recoverable grant was credited.</p>
        <p>For an example follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    The RCGF three year period should be calculated as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&pound;100,000 credited to the RCGF on 16.8.2010</li>
    <li>That is during the 2010/11 RCGF year</li>
    <li>The three year period following the year of credit is therefore 2011/2014</li>
    <li>If not spent by 31 March 2014 the &pound;100,000 will become subject to collection.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
        <p>5.9.3 When calculating the amount of three year old grant repayable to the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA, RPs (ex-RSLs) must calculate grant as having been spent on a first in, first out basis.</p>
        <p>For an example follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Operating on a first in, first out basis means that if by the end of the following third year, the RP (ex-RSL) has spent, in total, more than it deposited during the year in question, it has nothing to pay, e.g.:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>During the year ending 31 March 2010 &pound;500,000 was credited to the RCGF;</li>
    <li>The three year period is therefore 2011-2014;</li>
    <li>During 2011/2014 more than &pound;500,000 is spent</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Therefore there is no three year old grant</p>
</div>
        <p>5.9.4 If, by 31 March of the year in question, RPs (ex-RSLs) have entered into a written contractual commitment to incur expenditure on permitted uses, then that amount of RCGF can be treated as having been spent.</p>
        <p>Only the following count as contractual commitments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An exchange of contracts to acquire;</li>
          <li>Signing a building contract;</li>
          <li>Confirming to a HomeBuy applicant that they can seek a property to purchase (for HomeBuy Agents only).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>5.9.5 Contracts devised to avoid repayment of three-year-old grant are not acceptable. The Agency or within Greater London the GLA expects contractual commitments to result in the contracted expenditure being incurred within six months. On a building contract, that would mean signing building contracts and starting on site within six months.</p>
        <p>5.9.6 RPs (ex-RSLs) must not repay any outstanding three-year old grant to the Agency or for amounts generated within Greater London to the GLA until they receive an invoice as per 5.8.5 above.</p>

        <p>6.1.1 Grant recycled from the RCGF will have the same Funding Conditions and conditions of grant as if the scheme had been funded with new grant’, although properties provided from the RCGF are not subject to the Right To Acquire under section 180 of the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 and section 16 of the Housing Act 1996, except when RCGF is used in combination with the Disposal Proceeds Fund or new grant.</p>
        <p>6.1.2 RCGF balances previously ring fenced for use in key worker schemes, and grant recovered from previous key worker programmes (such as Starter Home Initiative, Key Worker Living etc) will no longer be subject to previous restrictions, and should be spent on the general permitted uses and in the first instance on the priorities indicated below.</p>
        <p>6.1.3 Generally RCGF can be spent on the following Permitted Uses (although these will be subject to some restrictions or additional criteria as detailed in 6.2 below):</p>
        <ul>

        <h4>Priorities</h4>
        <p>6.1.4 Whilst RCGF may be spent on the permitted uses described in 6.1.3 above the Agency will in the first instance require RPs (ex-RSLs) to spend RCGF on the Agency’s priorities.</p>
        <p>6.1.5 The Agency’s priorities for the reinvestment of RCGF include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The provision of new dwellings for <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/affordable-rent-0">Affordable Rent</a>; this can include new build, purchase of existing satisfactory and rehabilitation – however, please see 6.2.1 below</li>
          <li>Re-improvement or the physical conversion of existing owned larger properties into smaller properties that better suit local housing need, for Affordable Rent (refurbishment of existing stock which results in a property of the same size, or larger, is not a priority use for the reinvestment of RCGF).</li>
          <li>Flexible Tenure where it will prevent repossession and homelessness - provided the criteria in section 6.6 are met.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>6.1.6 Expenditure on uses other than provision of Affordable Rent or Flexible Tenure will require prior approval from the Agency’s Operating Area Office.</p>

        <h3><a href="#" class="closed"><span>6.2</span> Restrictions and or Additional Criteria to Permitted Uses</a></h3>
      </div>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <h4>6.2.1 Affordable Rent</h4>
        <p>RPs (ex-RSLs) that are not on their own, nor as part of a consortium, developing Affordable Rent under an agreed Framework Delivery Agreement may not use RCGF to provide Affordable Rent, unless they are party to a Short Form Agreement (SFA) with the Agency. The standard SFA is currently published on the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/sites/default/files/our-work/short_form_agreement_exrsl_registered_provider.pdf">HCA's website</a>.</p>
        <p>6.2.2 RPs (ex-RSLs) that are developing Affordable Rent under an agreed FDA may use their RCGF to provide additional Affordable Rent property. However they should use any ‘ring fenced’ credits (as per <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gr-recycled-capital-grant-fund-administration">5.2.7</a>) in the first instance.</p>
        <h4>6.2.3 HomeBuy (First Steps)</h4>
        <p>RPs (ex-RSLs) that are not on their own, or as part of a consortium, developing or providing affordable home ownership such as Shared Ownership or Equity Loans under an agreed Framework Delivery Agreement may not use RCGF to provide HomeBuy Equity Loans, although they may provide Shared Ownership, subject to the usual considerations of local authority support and value for money.</p>
        <h4>Mortgage Rescue</h4>
        <p>6.2.4 RPs (ex-RSLs) that have not been approved by the Agency to provide Mortgage Rescue products must not use RCGF balances to support either Government Mortgage to Rent or Shared Equity.</p>
        <p>For a list of Mortgage Rescue providers, please see the guidance box at <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/gmtr-overview">GMtR 1.2.2</a> or Shared Equity <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/se-overview">1.2.2</a>.</p>
        <p>6.2.5 RPs (ex-RSLs) that are listed providers of Mortgage Rescue products may use RCGF balances to support Mortgage Rescue (including the admin allowance element), provided that they adhere to the requirements contained within the chapter pertaining to the relevant product, i.e. <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/government-mortgage-rent">Government Mortgage to Rent</a> or <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/shared-equity">Shared Equity</a>. Please note that RPs (ex-RSLs) must not use RCGF for Mortgage Rescue until all of the new grant available has been allocated.</p>
        <h4>Social Rent</h4>
        <p>6.2.6 RPs (ex-RSLs) may only develop Social Rent with RCGF in limited circumstances, and only with prior approval of the Agency’s Operating Area. In all cases RPs (ex-RSLs) will require the support of their Local Authority. If RPs (ex-RSLs) are developing Affordable Rent under a Framework Delivery Agreement the RP will have to make a strong case as to why using RCGF for AR would not be a viable alternative.</p>
        <h4>Absolute Restrictions</h4>
        <p>6.2.7 Absolute restrictions on Permitted uses include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Funding Social HomeBuy or Right to Acquire discounts.</li>
          <li>Work to existing stock that is ineligible for funding because of the terms under which it was originally financed. Examples are major repairs to general needs projects funded under the Housing Acts 1988 and 1996 and stock transferred from a Local Authority.</li>
          <li>Day to day and cyclical maintenance.</li>
          <li>Tenant Incentive Schemes.</li>
          <li>Provision of the FirstBuy product.</li>
          <li>Leasehold enfranchisement.</li>

        <p>6.3.1 RPs (ex-RSLs) must apply their RCGF in accordance with the investment priorities of the relevant Local Investment Plans (LIPs) or similar agreed documentation and within Greater London the Mayor’s statutory London Housing Strategy and LIPs, and expenditure is expected to be for the provision of new affordable housing.</p>
        <p>6.3.2 RPs (ex-RSLs) may make the case for an alternative use to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meet other strategic priorities; and</li>
          <li>Ensure the RP (ex-RSL) remains financially viable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All requests must be submitted to the Agency’s Operating Area or for amounts generated within Greater London the GLA for consideration and approval.</p>
        <p>6.3.3 Investment in new affordable housing is now shaped primarily by LIPs or similar agreed documentation and within Greater London the Mayor’s statutory London Housing Strategy and LIPs. The default position is that spend should take place within the Local Authority area within which the credit to the fund was generated AND in line with the relevant LIPs or similar agreed documentation and within Greater London the Mayor’s statutory London Housing Strategy and LIPs. RPs’ (ex-RSLs') internal records of recoveries will therefore need to record the originating LA area in which the credit to the fund was generated.</p>
        <p>6.3.4 If RPs (ex-RSLs) wish to spend recycled grant in a different Local Authority from that in which it had originated, but within an Operating Area’s sub-area, they must inform the Operating Area (or the GLA for amounts generated in Greater London) prior to entering into any commitment that is to be fully or partly funded from RCGF.</p>
        <p>For information on sub-areas follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    All of the Operating Areas and within Greater London the London boroughs have adopted the concept of sub-areas and sub-regions respectively for the 2011-15 AHP, but Operating Areas have defined these differently. For instance, an Operating Area may define sub-areas in terms of LIPs, or alternatively county councils may be used. RPs (ex-RSLs) should refer to the relevant Operating Area to ascertain details of any sub-areas or within Greater London the London borough agreed sub-regions.</p>
</div>
        <p>6.3.5 However, if RPs (ex-RSLs) wish to spend recycled grant in a different sub-area from that in which it originated, but still within the same Operating Area they must consult with the Operating Area prior to entering into any commitment that is to be fully or partly funded from RCGF.  In considering such proposals the Operating Area will take into account the clarity of its sub-area definitions and importance given to sub-areas in their location.</p>
        <p>6.3.6 In exceptional circumstances two or more RPs (ex-RSLs) may collaborate to spend RCGF outside the Operating Area in which the grant originated – for details follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>Expenditure of RCGF is permissible outside the Operating Area within which the credit to the fund was generated except in the case of Greater London where RCGF generated in Greater London is only to be spent within Greater London. Where the proposed spend is for a priority use (please see 6.1.4 above), subject to the arrangement of an equivalent reverse flow of RCGF from the Operating Area in which the planned spend is taking place to the Operating Area in which the transferred RCGF was generated, to be agreed with another RP (ex-RSLs) (i.e. there would be little or no effect on net RCGF expenditure in the two Operating Areas).</p>
  <p>Under these circumstances expenditure will normally only be considered where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The expenditure is greater than &pound;1m;</li>
    <li>The difference between the two flows is less than 5% of the larger;</li>
    <li>Spend of the full amounts will occur in the same financial year; and</li>
    <li>The expenditure will create new supply in Growth areas/Growth points or on strategic sites identified in Local Investment Plans or similar agreed documentation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    &nbsp;</p>
  <p>HCA Operating Areas have the flexibility to waive the above requirements for inter Operating Area transfers, where they are in agreement. Decisions on whether to relax the requirements are a matter for agreement between the Operating Areas concerned.</p>
</div>
        <p>Please note that from 1 April 2012 amounts generated within Greater London should not be invested outside Greater London, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>6.3.7 RPs (ex-RSLs) must also consult the Operating Area if a credit to the fund generated in a rural or Protected Area (defined as an area with a population below 10,000 or one designated by legislation as being a Protected Area) is to be spent in a non-rural area. RPs’ (ex-RSLs') internal records of recoveries must therefore record cases where the credit to the fund originates in a rural or Protected Area.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>6.5.1 Although a priority for the 2011-15 Affordable Homes Programme, Flexible Tenure (also referred to or known as downward staircasing) is a permitted use of the RCGF only in cases where other options for avoiding repossession have been exhausted. It is a last resort option to enable a shared owner (NOT an outright owner) experiencing severe financial difficulties to remain in their own home despite changes in their financial circumstances. It is aimed at preventing repossessions and the loss of the home. It is not a means of allowing the shared owner to restructure their debts (including rent arrears) or otherwise improve their financial position.</p>
        <p>6.5.2 There is no ‘right’ to Flexible Tenure and any offer is purely at the RP's (ex-RSL's) discretion. However, where offered by RPs (ex-RSLs) the following eligibility criteria must be met:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>RPs (ex-RSLs) must confine offers of Flexible Tenure to shared owners in their own stock, but can include both grant funded and non grant funded stock;</li>
          <li>RPs (ex-RSLs) may set their own detailed procedures provided that they comply with the required general policy and procedures in this section of the Recovery chapter.</li>
          <li>The shared owner must currently own less than 100% of the property.</li>
          <li>The shared owner must be paying rent on the unsold equity in the property. The term ‘rent’ excludes ground rent and service charges. Flexible Tenure is not available for other owner occupiers including former shared owners or those who have bought a property through a discount or incentive scheme such as Right To Buy (RTB), Right To Acquire (RTA), the Tenants’ Incentive Scheme (no longer available) or any of the Agency’s equity loan products. Home owners in mortgage difficulties who have purchased under these schemes may be eligible for assistance on the <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/mortgage-rescue">Mortgage Rescue Scheme</a>.</li>
          <li>RPs (ex-RSLs) must be satisfied that the shared owner has explored and exhausted other options. The shared owner must produce suitable evidence to prove their difficulty with mortgage repayments although they need not already be in mortgage arrears. Shared owners must be able to show that other short and long term options have been exhausted such as loan rescheduling, or selling and moving to cheaper property within a reasonable travel to work area.</li>
          <li>RPs (ex-RSLs) must also take into account the shared owner’s ongoing ability to meet future repair and maintenance liabilities.</li>
          <li>Future sustainability should be based upon advice from an independent debt-counselling agency, and should include consideration of Housing Benefit eligibility.</li>
          <li>For Shared Ownership for the Elderly properties, the same policy applies. However, Flexible Tenure repurchase from the maximum shares permitted under this product will also be permitted to allow essential repair and maintenance work to be carried out where the leaseholder demonstrates that there is a need for such work to the property and that they lack the funds to pay for it.</li>
          <li>For non-grant funded stock, should RPs (ex-RSLs) consider repurchasing all the leaseholders shares thereby converting the tenure to an assured tenancy, they must undertake a survey of the property before completion of the Flexible Tenure application in order to assess any immediate and future repair liabilities that would be required under the Regulator’s Social Housing Standards.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>6.5.3 RPs (ex-RSLs) cannot use RCGF funds to help shared owners release equity for any other purpose than avoiding threats, or potential threats, to their ability to remain in their home. RCGF funds cannot be used to allow shared owners to repay debt (other than their principal mortgage debt and arrears), or to buy other goods or services. This is NOT Flexible Tenure.</p>
        <p>6.5.4 The Disposal Proceeds Fund cannot fund flexible tenure.</p>
        <p>6.5.5 Under Flexible Tenure, RPs (ex-RSLs) must repurchase enough equity to reduce the leaseholder’s total housing costs to a level which they, and the RPs (ex-RSLs), are confident is manageable and sustainable in the long-term.</p>
        <p>6.5.6 This can include repurchasing sufficient equity to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clear the mortgage.</li>
          <li>Pay off arrears of interest and principal on the mortgage.</li>
          <li>Reduce mortgage payments to nil.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>6.5.7 In order to meet the needs as per the above paragraph, the repurchase of shares by RPs under Flexible Tenure is not restricted to particular tranches in the same way as for upward staircasing. For further guidance follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    In order to repurchase sufficient equity as per the requirements at 6.6.5a, RPs (ex-RSLs) may repurchase shares of any percentage, and are not restricted to 10% tranches. A repurchase of shares may also be to a level where the shared owner retains less than 25%.<br />
    <br />
    Where RPs (ex-RSLs) are considering repurchases which will leave the shared owner with less than 25%, they should discuss the implications with the shared owner and make clear that under the terms of the shared ownership lease s/he will still have full responsibility for any repairs.</p>
</div>
        <p>6.5.8 There is also the option of full re-purchase, under which the shared owner becomes an assured tenant of the RP (ex-RSL). However, once a property has been re-possessed by the lender, Flexible Tenure ceases to be an option. For a cautionary note follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    The change from shared ownership to a tenancy shifts the insurance, maintenance and repairing obligations from the ex-leaseholder to the RP (ex-RSL). Therefore it is recommended that the RP (ex-RSL) carries out a survey of the property before completion of the flexible tenure application in order to assess any immediate and future repair liabilities under the Regulatory Standards.</p>
</div>
        <p>6.5.9 Where an RP (ex-RSL) does offer Flexible Tenure, its policy and procedures should be published and made available to all shared owners in its property. RPs (ex-RSL) should also ensure they retain any documentary evidence in support of their decision to use RCGF to fund Flexible Tenure.</p>
        <p>6.5.10 For any form of equity repurchase, the RP (ex-RSL) should ensure that any offer is acceptable to both the shared owner’s mortgagee, and its own lender. The latter may require a revolving credit facility.</p>
        <p>6.5.11 The same general procedures apply to downward staircasing as for upward staircasing, i.e. the maximum amount payable by the landlord will be the appropriate percentage of the shares to be purchased at their current open market vacant value as determined by an independent qualified valuer.</p>
        <p>6.5.12 It will probably be a condition of the shared owner’s mortgage that the sale proceeds are paid direct to the first mortgagee. The RP's (ex-RSL's) solicitor should advise on this, but it would avoid any risk of misuse of the money. The shared owner must pay for the valuation and his/her own legal fees. In practice, if paid by the RP (ex-RSL), these costs may be deducted from the payment to the shared owner or the mortgagee</p>
        <p>6.5.13 The amount to be debited should be drawn down from the RCGF on the completion date of the legal transaction, and calculated as follows:</p>
        <p>Debit from RCGF = (staircasing sales allowance) + (payment due for the shares to be purchased x 70%).</p>
        <p>The payment due to the shared owner or mortgagee must be the market value of the share to be repurchased. However only 70% of that share’s market value is the maximum that can be funded with RCGF. The remaining balance must be funded from an RP's (ex-RSL's) own resources. Lesser amounts of RCGF topped up by the landlords own resources are also permitted.</p>
        <p>For an explanation of why 70% is allowable click on the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    Following a review of the grant funding regime Total Cost Indicators were abolished with effect from April 2006 in favour of the current competitive bidding framework.<br />
    <br />
    TCIs had been a key objective of the then funding regime to ensure the correct level of grant was paid, and were divided into unit type and cost group areas, Based on TCIs, the maximum level of grant payable differed depending on the location, as cost group areas were linked to local authority areas.<br />
    <br />
    Prior to the demise of TCIs the cost group area percentages featured in the calculation of how much RCGF could be used to fund Flexible Tenure. As local authority based percentages were no longer available from April 2006 the Agency considered that an amount equivalent to a maximum of 70% would be suitable for all Flexible Tenure repurchases.<br />
    <br />
    Use the staircasing sales allowance at the level current on the date of completion of the Flexible Tenure transaction.</p>
</div>
        <p>6.5.14 The resulting amount of public subsidy (HAG, SHG or SHA plus Recycled Capital Grant) attributable to the property must take into account any deferred Recovery of HAG, SHG or SHA in the same scheme (see the worked examples below).</p>
        <p>6.5.15 The resulting Deemed Loan Debt (DLD) for the property will be the outstanding balance of the original DLD plus the new DLD attributable to the repurchased part of the property (i.e. the 30% (or more) of the payment to the leaseholder that was not funded by RCGF).</p>
        <p>For a worked example please follow the link.</p>
<div class="content_description">
  <p>
    A shared owner owns 75% of a house valued at &pound;160,000, and staircases down to 25% ownership.<br />
    <br />
    The owning RP (ex-RSL) pays &pound;79,400 to the shared owner&rsquo;s mortgage company (&pound;80,000 less valuation and the shared owner&rsquo;s legal fees totalling &pound;600).<br />
    <br />
    The staircasing sales allowance is (for illustrative purposes) &pound;400.<br />
    <br />
    The withdrawal from the RCGF is (&pound;400 staircasing allowance) + (&pound;80,000 x 70%) = &pound;56,400<br />
    <br />
    If the rent is 2.75% of the value of the equity owned by the RP (ex-RSL) per annum, the rent increases from &pound;21 a week on 25% to &pound;63 a week on the 75% now owned by the RP (ex-RSL) - ignoring any service charge.<br />
    <br />
    The RP (ex-RSL) has increased the Deemed Loan Debt on the property by the element of the payment to the leaseholder that was not funded by the RCGF i.e. 30% x &pound;80,000 = &pound;24,000.</p>
</div>
        <p>6.5.16 Should the shared owner’s financial circumstances deteriorate even further, subsequent Flexible Tenure is permitted; and if necessary, additional Flexible Tenure transactions can be permitted, even to the extent of a complete repurchase of the property – see 6.6.20 below.</p>
        <p>6.5.17 Where a shared owner benefits from Flexible Tenure to reduce their share to a lower level of equity, the terms of the existing lease will continue, including the right to staircase again.</p>
        <p>6.5.18 Where a shared owner’s financial circumstances improve and they wish to purchase additional shares, then normal staircasing procedures should be followed. In these cases, RP (ex-RSL) must treat the RCGF drawn down to fund the Flexible Tenure as if it were new grant, and add this sum to any outstanding original funding for grant recovery purposes.</p>
        <p>6.5.19 Whenever the shared owner benefits from Flexible Tenure or staircases again, the rent should be adjusted pro rata for the changed percentage rented, and comply with all relevant rent policies.</p>
        <p>6.5.20 Where a shared owner becomes an outright tenant, the shared ownership lease must be formally terminated and an assured tenancy agreement entered into on the same terms as for any other new tenancy agreement for rented housing let by that RP (ex-RSL). For a comment please follow the link.</p>
        <p>6.5.21 An ex-shared owner who becomes an outright tenant will not be able to purchase the property under the Right To Acquire because the property was not originally provided with public money for the purposes of being a rented property. This means it would not be an eligible property under RTA rules. However the assured tenancy would count towards future RTA residency criteria (please see <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/rta-applicant-eligibility">RTA 2.2</a>). As a tenant s/he may, if circumstances improve, be eligible for any discount or incentive scheme if offered by the RP (ex-RSL), such as Social HomeBuy with any eligibility period starting from the date of this new tenancy.</p>

      <div class="hidden-content">
        <p>7.2.1 RPs who operate an RCGF must submit an annual RCGF End of Year Return electronically using the HCA’s IMS. It is the RP’s responsibility to ensure its return is submitted on time. The deadline for returns is 30 June of the year in question.</p>
        <p>From 2012/13 onwards, RCGF returns should be split between London returns to the GLA and outside London to the HCA. RPs who operate both inside and outside London should file two separate returns. Note that the GLA may have different reporting requirements form the HCA and therefore the description of the completion of the return at 7.2.4 pertains to the HCA's return only.</p>
        <p>RPs must submit a return for every year that they have been in business and operating an RCGF, even if they no longer are. For example, if an RP was subject to a transfer of engagements that completed in March 2013, a return would still be required for the year 2012-13.</p>
        <p>7.2.2 In the event that an RP misses the deadline for submitting its End of Year Returnand has a good reason for not having met the deadline, they should submit their return on IMS as normal. There is no longer a requirement to make a request for the system to be re-opened first. Submission of a late return will activate a ‘Late Submission Comment’ box.  Providers must fill this in when submitting a late return.  This will reviewed by the relevant contract manager to sign off.</p>
        <p>7.2.3 The HCA or within Greater London the GLA may seek repayment and can require Repayment of all or part of the balance of an RCGF if information is not supplied to schedule, including either a late or absent annual End of Year Return.</p>
        <h4>Completion of the annual return</h4>
        <p>7.2.4 The annual End of Year Return will consist of a number of screens within the HCA’s IMS:</p>

        <p>7.2.5 The general details screen is self-explanatory, but RPs should remember that adding a contact name for their organisation is mandatory.</p>
        <p>7.2.6 The financial screen shows both the opening balances and closing balances, with a different ledger line for each type of expenditure, each labelled with a letter.</p>
        <p>From 2014 the HCA is introducing some limited changes to the Financial screen, these are as follows;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A new withdrawals row to capture conversion or re-improvement of existing owned properties into smaller units for Affordable Rent.</li>
          <li>The addition of two new columns to capture starts and completions delivered from withdrawal categories outside of the Affordable Homes Programme; and</li>
          <li>Additional lines to capture balances for years 0 and 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first lines relate to opening balances arising from inputs that RPs have been accrued from the previous financial year, arising from:</p>

          <li>Total interest after tax as of 31 March (Line E).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>RPs must show separately within the Financial screen what their RCGF withdrawals have been spent on:</p>
        <ul>

        <p>This screen will also include details of prior year adjustments at line Y and closing balances (after tax at 31 March) at line Z. RPs are also required to record amounts of 0,1,2 and 3-year-old RCGF at lines AA and AD and 3 year interest at line AE.</p>
        <p>7.2.7 In the Analysis of Inputs window, RPs must show separately the origin of sums credited to the fund as a result of different kinds of relevant events. Please see the online guide for details of these.</p>
        <p>7.2.8 RPs will need to retain relevant records for the analysis of balances by local authority screen. These must cover the following data in respect of each relevant local authority:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Opening balance</li>
          <li>Inputs</li>
          <li>Withdrawals</li>
          <li>Transfers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>7.2.9 In the analysis of housing completions screen, RPs must  show in their End of Year Return details of units completed in the year of the return, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scheme number</li>
          <li>Scheme address</li>

          <li>Reserves contribution</li>
          <li>Private finance contribution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>7.2.10 In the statement of intentions screen, RPs are required to indicate proposals for the reinvestment of 2-year-old RCGF.</p>
        <p>7.2.11 The RP certification and signature screen should only be completed once the RP is satisfied that all other screens are complete and correct and be signed off (and dated) by the RP's authorised signatory.</p>
