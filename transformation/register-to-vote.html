          <p>This page will keep you up to date on the progress of the 1st exemplar in our <a href="/transformation">Transformation programme</a> – Electoral registration.</p>

          <p>Right now it contains our <a href="#digital-strategy">original strategy statement</a> for the exemplar, the <a href="#business-case">business case</a> we've developed during the discovery phase of the programme, a quick description of <a href="#benefits">the benefits we aim to deliver to users</a> and other useful background information – as available.</p>

          <p>As the programme continues you'll be able to see progress reflected here and the information will become richer – there'll be links to the programme blog, screenshots of software in development and more and better data as we learn more about the delivery of the service.</p>

          <p>ERTP will change voter registration by making it individual (no longer done by the ‘head of the household’), creating a new digital channel and confirming identities before accepting registrations. There will be a large set-up cost: ERTP is being done for policy reasons (to ensure elections are fair), not to save money. If ERTP produces a higher quality voter register, it may ultimately help abolish the annual “canvass” (which confirms the voter list every year): this would be a large saving, but no decision has been taken.</p>
