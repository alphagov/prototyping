        <h1>Issue</h1>

        <p>Our railways are increasingly busy. Demand for long distance rail travel
          has doubled in the past 15 years, and Britain’s population is forecast
          to increase by 10 million over the next 25 years.</p>

        <p>Good transport links make our economy stronger and our lives easier.
          Congested transport networks are unreliable and constrain travel
          opportunities, restricting growth.</p>

        <p>We plan to invest more than £70 billion in all forms of transport by
          2021. High Speed 2 (HS2) is part of this, accounting for £16 billion of
          this investment.</p>

        <h1>Actions</h1>

        <p>We are developing HS2 to provide Britain’s railways with new capacity,
          better connectivity and quicker journeys.</p>

        <p>HS2 will link 8 of Britain’s 10 largest cities, serving 1 in 5 of the
          UK population. It will allow more passengers to use trains and more
          freight operators to use rail rather than road.</p>

        <p>The new railway will greatly increase capacity. It will treble the
          number of seats on trains into Euston and almost double the number of
          trains per hour on the West Coast Main Line.</p>

        <p>It will free up capacity on existing rail lines for more commuter,
          rural and freight train services, and mean fewer cars and lorries on
          our roads, cutting congestion and carbon.</p>

        <p>The new railway will be <a href="#">an engine for economic growth</a>.
          HS2 will generate jobs and help rebalance the economy between north
          and south.</p>

        <p>We will build HS2 in 2 phases. The first phase will link London Euston
          with a new station at Birmingham Curzon Street and will include a
          station at Old Oak Common in west London and another near Birmingham
          Airport. For the second phase the route will divide into 2 lines, one
          to Manchester Piccadilly via Crewe and Manchester Airport and the other
          to Leeds via the East Midlands and Sheffield Meadowhall.</p>

        <p>See an <a href="#">overview of the proposed HS2 route.</a></p>

        <p>HS2 will be integrated with the existing national railway network and
          HS2 trains will be compatible with existing railway lines, so that
          cities and towns beyond the new network – such as Liverpool, Glasgow,
          Edinburgh, Newcastle, York, Preston, Warrington, Lancaster, Carlisle,
          Durham and Darlington - will also benefit from direct HS2 services.</p>

        <p>Construction along the line is due to start in 2017 and be completed
          by 2025. The first train services will run between London and
          Birmingham from 2026.</p>

        <p>We recognise that a scheme on the scale of HS2 will have impacts on
          the local environment and communities and we’re committed to
          <a href="#">minimising these impacts and treating those affected
            fairly.</a></p>
