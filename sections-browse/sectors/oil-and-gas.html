    <h2 class="topic">What is the government doing about&nbsp;energy?</h2>
    <p>Oil and gas reserves are declining but the UK must have safe, secure and future-proof supplies of energy that are available to all. Through international relations and supporting the energy industry, the government will ensure continuous supply of energy for the UK.</p>

      <h3>Policies</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Helping households to cut their energy bills</a>
          <p>Rising energy prices are affecting many households. The government can’t control unpredictable global energy prices but we can help households keep their energy bills as low as possible</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Increasing the use of low-carbon technologies</a>
          <p>Increasing the amount of energy the UK gets from low-carbon technologies such as renewables and nuclear, and reducing emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Reducing demand for energy from industry, businesses and the public sector</a>
          <p>Large public and private sector organisations in the UK are sensitive to rising energy prices because energy can account for a large part of their operating costs. These sectors are also responsible for a significant proportion of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Using evidence and analysis to inform energy and climate change policies</a>
          <p>To create effective policies to mitigate the effects of climate change and meet the UK’s energy demand</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Maintaining UK energy security</a>
          <p>Energy security is about making sure consumers can access the energy they need at prices that are not excessively volatile</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Providing regulation and licensing of energy industries and infrastructure</a>
          <p>Make sure all environmental impacts are assessed and managed, and work sites and working conditions as safe as possible</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Managing the use and disposal of radioactive and nuclear substances and waste</a>
          <p>Radioactive substances (nuclear and non-nuclear) are used in a variety of ways that benefit people, for example in nuclear power generation, hospitals, pharmaceuticals and research. However, the hazards of using radioactive substances must be properly controlled to prevent harm to people and the environment</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#">Reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050</a>
          <p>The 2008 Climate Change Act established the world’s first legally binding climate change target. We aim to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% (from the 1990 baseline) by 2050</p>
