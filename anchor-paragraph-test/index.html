</figure><p>I am proud to lead an agency that over the last year has delivered: </p>

<ul>
<li>the ‘ Best Overall Contact Centre of the Year’ awarded by the  Contact Centre Association (CCA) </li>
  <li>Customer Service Excellence accreditation</li>
  <li>continuous insurance enforcement to combat uninsured driving</li>
  <li>nearly £40 million saving against £100 million annual running costs by 2014 to 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>2013 to 2014 will be another challenging year for the agency as we manage a register of nearly 37 million vehicle records and over 44 million driver records and collect around £6 billion in vehicle excise duty.</p>

<p>During 2013, after planning and public consultation, we will be implementing the transformation and modernisation of our network services. This will mean the phased closure of 39 local offices. Managers will do all they can to assist dedicated and experienced staff to prepare themselves for something new.</p>

<p>Modernisation will mean centralising work in Swansea and will lead to efficiency savings. Customers will continue to receive high levels of service but through predominantly digital channels. We are also planning for motorists in Northern Ireland to have the option of relicensing their vehicle online.</p>

<p>We will pick up the pace on our IT contract let programme, working with a range of suppliers, we will take forward our contribution to the Government Digital Strategy,  build modern (Greenfield) IT platforms and three further digital services announced by the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State:</p>

<ul>
<li>integrated enquiry platform: to handle 10 million enquiries a year from insurers and others</li>
  <li>vehicles online: to manage 17 million sale or disposal transactions every year</li>
  <li>personalised vehicle registrations: around 1 million transactions a year</li>
</ul>
<p>A theme running through this business plan is making further improvements in our efficiency and effectiveness as we continue to build on the £39.7 million achieved to save £100 million in our annual running costs by 2014 to 2015. In recognition of this change to our operating cost base, we will conduct a review of fee income and future investment requirements and propose a strategy for the future that rebalances and limits charges imposed on motorists whilst ensuring the long-term continuation of DVLA services. </p>

<p>During the year ahead, we will take action after considering responses to consultations on:</p>

<ul>
<li>removing the insurance check when taxing a vehicle</li>
  <li>the future of the Department for Transport Motoring Services Group</li>
</ul>
<p>I have announced that I will be leaving the agency in April 2013 to take up a post in the Department for Work and Pensions. <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> have commenced the search for my replacement whose responsibility it will be to deliver this plan and lead the agency forward.</p>

  DVLA is an Executive Agency of the Department for Transport (<abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr>) and is responsible for maintaining over 44 million driver records and almost 37 million vehicle records. </p>

<h4 id="our-vision">Our vision:</h4>
<p>Customers are at the heart of our business and drive everything we do. Our digital services and our people exceed our customers’ expectations. </p>

<h4 id="our-key-purpose">Our key purpose</h4>
<p>Our key purpose is to ensure that complete and accurate registers of drivers and vehicles are held and we make them as accessible and as flexible as possible, to those who have the right to use them.</p>

<p>These registers underpin action by DVLA, the police and others to maintain the high levels of road safely experienced in the UK and the effective collection of vehicle excise duty (<abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr>). DVLA registers are used to deliver other departmental and government initiatives such as traffic management and reducing carbon emissions.</p>

<p>We want to be seen as a world class organisation in managing the collection, storage and provision of accurate data relating to driving entitlements and vehicles and the collection of motoring taxes.</p>

  Since 2002, DVLA has consistently developed new digital services making it easier for customers to transact with us whilst delivering significant savings. To go further, we now need to become an organisation that is digital by default. </p>

<h4 id="compliance-and-enforcement">Compliance and enforcement</h4>
<p>The agency collects around £6 billion a year in <abbr title="Vehicle Excise Duty">VED</abbr> and is responsible for limiting tax evasion to no more than 1% per year. 
We operate continuous insurance enforcement, a joint government and insurance industry initiative to combat uninsured driving.</p>

<p>DVLA also supports the police and intelligence authorities in dealing with vehicle related crime.</p>

<h4 id="dvla-personalised-registrations">DVLA personalised registrations</h4>
<p><a rel="external" href="http://dvlaregistrations.direct.gov.uk/">DVLA personalised registrations</a> offer a range of unissued registration numbers for customers to buy online or at auction. Since its launch in 1989, the agency has collected over £1.8 billion on behalf of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 id="the-purpose-of-this-business-plan">The purpose of this business plan</h4>
<p>The purpose of this business plan is to map out our digital journey and show how the needs of our customers and partners will be met.</p>

<p>Our business plan is supported by <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and the Cabinet Office and has been agreed by our sponsors.</p>

<p>Progress against performance set out in this business plan will be reported on our website.  </p>

<p>DVLA Annual Report and Accounts 2013 to 2014 will detail the end of year performance. </p>

<h2 id="how-the-agency-is-changing">
<span class="number">3. </span>How the Agency is changing</h2>

<h3 id="our-strategic-direction">
<span class="number">3.1 </span>Our strategic direction</h3>
<p>In the ten years since DVLA’s first electronic transaction was introduced, the demand for digital services from our customers has grown to an extent that we have been unable to meet. We aim to put this right. </p>

<h4 id="digital-by-default">Digital by default</h4>
<p>Since 2002, the DVLA change programme has consistently introduced services that have reduced the volume of paper transactions by 58% through online or digitally assisted services (via the web, the post office or other commercial enterprises).This digital direction is the core of the DVLA operational change programme. We will consistently aim to provide the most efficient, effective services to meet the needs of a diverse but ever growing digitally aware customer base, whilst recognising the needs of the important minority through assisted digital services. </p>

<p>To ensure that DVLA is in step with the wider <a rel="external" href="http://my.civilservice.gov.uk/reform/">Civil Service Reform Plan</a>, the <a rel="external" href="http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/">Government Digital Strategy</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/">The Red Tape Challenge</a> we have reset our organisational vision. Our new vision summarises where we are going, not where we are today: </p>

<p>Customers are at the heart of our business and drive everything we do. Our digital services and our people exceed our customers’ expectations.</p>

<p>This is no easy task. To achieve the vision we will need to become an organisation that is digital by default, with services so good that people want to use the digital one first. This in turn, will involve working relentlessly to: </p>

<ul>
<li>redesign our business and processes around customer needs to cater for the digital world that we all now live in and keep up with future technology changes </li>
  <li>develop our staff and managers so that we have the skills to deliver, know what we are working to achieve and can all apply this strategy in our day to day work </li>
  <li>change our culture to become a responsive, agile and empowered organisation</li>
  <li>ensure personal data is held safely, increasing accuracy and continuing to achieve high levels of motoring tax compliance</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Vision diagram" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/12494/New-vision_960x640.jpg"></div>
</figure><p>Our customers are many and varied, they include:</p>

<ul>
<li>motorists</li>
  <li>businesses </li>
  <li>ministers and their officials (in <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and other government departments) </li>
  <li>other government agencies and organisations </li>
  <li>the police </li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we want them to receive even better services at a lower cost. </p>

<p>We will measure our progress in delivering the vision against the following headline milestones to:</p>

<ul>
<li>review all services with more than 100,000 transactions per year from a ‘user needs’ perspective by March 2014</li>
  <li>deliver three exemplar digital services – vehicles online, personalised registration and integrated enquiry platform by 2015 </li>
  <li>ensure all services with more than 100,000 transactions per year will be available by digital and assisted digital channels by 2017</li>
  <li>achieve over 80% digital take up for over 80% of our services by 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>These initial milestones will be reviewed annually with progress reported in our Annual Report for 2013 to 2014. We intend to add milestones to: </p>

<ul>
<li>increase first time task completion rates for our core services  </li>
  <li>increase user satisfaction with our services</li>
  <li>increase digital take-up before 2020</li>
  <li>reduce our baseline operating expenditure</li>
  <li>reduce the costs per transaction of our core services reducing fees for the motorist</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="it-contract-let">IT Contract Let</h4>
<p>During 2013 to 2014 DVLA will prepare the ground for our major IT contract let. This will reduce the future cost of hosting the driver and vehicle database and open up the prospect of introducing state of the art open source systems to replace the agency’s tired and out of support bespoke software.   </p>

<p>We will accelerate the actions we are taking to replace our systems with modern, industry standard, open-source systems which will be more flexible to meet changing demands and which can be supported and maintained at much lower cost. </p>

<p>In 2013 to 2014 we will plan and agree how we will move our services to new systems and when we will de-commission and shut down old systems. During the year we will work to ensure the agency and its staff have the skills and structures needed to manage this transfer, the new systems and the new contracts and support arrangements we need to purchase. Our plans are in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/department-for-transport-digital-strategy">Government’s <abbr title="Information Communication Technology">ICT</abbr> and Digital strategies and standards</a>.</p>

<h4 id="modernisation-of-network-services">Modernisation of network services</h4>
<p>During the year, DVLA will complete the closure of all 39 local offices and regional enforcement offices. We will use 4,500 post offices offering front office counter services to carry out assisted digital transactions for customers. We are also planning to introduce digital and assisted digital transactions for our customers in Northern Ireland, improving service quality and convenience.</p>

<h4 id="increased-efficiency">Increased efficiency</h4>
<p>With the procurement of new and improved contracts for the purchase of plastic cards for driving licences and for the provision of vehicle tax enforcement services, the first phase of our efficiency programme will end. The efficiency programme will achieve a further £60 million a year savings and will lift the agency’s savings to £100 million a year by 2015.</p>

<p>We will pursue further savings as we replace our IT systems and customer take-up of digital services reaches full potential with users directly managing their own data more effectively. This will save money avoiding the cost of paper handling and for customers the need to travel to transact across a counter or to post documents to DVLA.</p>

<h4 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h4>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Efficiency diagram" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/12495/Efficiency-diagram_960x640.jpg"></div>
</figure><p>Other significant deliveries in 2013 to 2014 will be: </p>

<ul>
<li>digital access being explored with the motor insurance industry to allow them to check driver records and cut the cost of motor insurance policies</li>
  <li>new online facilities to allow motorists to report a change of vehicle keeper and start a personalised registration transaction, these were promised in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/department-for-transport-digital-strategy"><abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> Digital Strategy</a> </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="risks-to-delivery-of-the-change-portfolio">Risks to delivery of the change portfolio</h4>
<p>DVLA’s change portfolio will require significant investment to make savings that will recur year-on-year. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/department-for-transport-digital-strategy">DFT Digital Strategy</a> puts in place a series of checks and assurance reviews to ensure investment is well focused before too much money is spent. Whilst we steer our proposed changes through assurance stages and pay careful attention to the feedback and guidance we receive, there is a risk of delay to the delivery of benefits.</p>

<p>There are particular risks associated with the scale and complexity of the contract let programme.</p>

<p>We will mitigate these risks by giving early warning and access to a wide range of reviewers to our proposals during the process, so that we present and validate evidence to show that we are pursuing a best value approach. </p>

<h3 id="policy-development">
<span class="number">3.2 </span>Policy development</h3>

<p>DVLA will continue to comply with EU statutory requirements and is supporting the government commitments to reducing the burden of regulation following the launch of the <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> Road Transport <a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/">Red Tape Challenge</a>.  </p>

<p>DVLA will work with the Cabinet Office and make use of legislative reform powers to expand opportunities for <a rel="external" href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/about">digital by default</a>.
We will make the case for revising legislation and policy, we will analyse DVLA data systems to support evidence based policymaking and provide data reports to <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and wider government. The agency is helping to simplify and reduce the compliance burden imposed on both the public and business. We will continue to be the main contact point with <abbr title="Department for Transport">DfT</abbr> and ministers and ensure compliance with regulation and consultation principles. </p>

<h4 id="during-2013-to-2014-we-will">During 2013 to 2014 we will</h4>

<ul>
<li>support the <a rel="external" href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/home/index/">Red Tape Challenge</a> by:
    <ul>
<li>stopping the need for statutory off road notification, once declared off the road for the first time</li>
      <li>issuing vehicle registration certificates to fleet operators only on request </li>
      <li>removing the requirement for the check of motor insurance certificates during vehicle excise duty transactions</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li>introduce a road levy for HGV road users in the UK by April 2014</li>
  <li>support the delivery of an electronic enquiry service for sharing DVLA data with authorised recipients  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="joined-up-working-across-government">
<span class="number">3.3 </span>Joined up working across government</h3>

<p>DVLA will continue to work across government as one of the leaders in the government <a rel="external" href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/about">digital by default</a> strategy.</p>

<h4 id="during-2013-to-2014-we-will-1">During 2013 to 2014 we will</h4>

<ul>
<li>support Department of Work and Pensions move away from Disabled Living Allowance to Personal Independence Payments </li>
  <li>continue work to introduce e-services in Northern Ireland which will give parity of service with motorists in the rest of the UK</li>
  <li>reduce VAT evasion - work with HM Revenue &amp; Customs to introduce an electronic system to ensure that importers have paid VAT before registering and licensing an imported vehicle</li>
  <li>update the technology that allows DVLA to check certain driving licence transactions with other EU Member States </li>
</ul>
<p>This will:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce document fraud and forgery</li>
  <li>reduce driving licence tourism, while improving road safety </li>
  <li>facilitate the free movement of driving licence holders</li>
  <li>speed up the driving licence issue and verification process</li>

</figure><h2 id="sustainability">
<span class="number">6. </span>Sustainability</h2>

<p>DVLA is aware of the need to be sustainable. There are increasing environmental, economic and social pressures and the agency is developing its business in a way that will enable it to succeed.</p>

<p>The government has set its departments and executive agencies a number of targets to achieve, the <a rel="external" href="http://sd.defra.gov.uk/gov/green-government/commitments/">Greening Government Commitments (GGC)</a>. These targets will be achieved over a five-year period (starting from a 2009 to 2010 baseline) by 2014 to 2015. In addition, we have set our own internal targets to improve our performance.</p>

<p>As well as ongoing improvements in energy efficiency, DVLA has significant initiatives in progress: </p>

<ul>
<li>consolidating and reducing the number of data centre rooms by virtualising and increasing utilisation of servers</li>
  <li>reviewing the lighting across the whole estate</li>
  <li>investing in renewable energy such as photovoltaic panels and wind turbines</li>
</ul>
<p>In light of the closure of DVLA local services network, there will be an increase in travel during 2013 to 2014. The agency has not set a travel related reduction target for the year (we expect an increase from 2010 to 2011 in the total amount of travel for one year only). Once the local offices have closed, we expect our business travel to reduce.</p>

<h3 id="waste-minimisation-and-disposal">
<span class="number">6.1 </span>Waste minimisation and disposal</h3>
<p>DVLA will continue to review its waste. The agency separate and monitor waste through 45 different streams. These streams include waste items such as photocard licences, toner cartridges, trade plates, aluminium cans and glass. 
DVLA’s biggest waste stream is paper, this accounts for 64% of total waste. Whilst the agency recycles all paper through the <a rel="external" href="http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Government Procurement Service</a> closed loop initiative, we recognise that there is more we can do to reduce the amount of waste we produce.</p>

<figure class="image embedded"><div class="img"><img alt="Sustainability" src="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/12502/Sustainability_960x640.jpg"></div>
</figure><h3 id="disposal">
<span class="number">6.2 </span>Disposal</h3>

<p>DVLA recycle in excess of 80% of waste, over the next two years we will increase this by 5% by examining the waste sent to landfill sites. Much of the Agency waste fits into established recycling schemes; however, our processes for sorting waste can be improved.  </p>

<p>During 2013 to 2014 we will improve segregation and overall waste disposal and look for further improvements to the waste paper produced via the production processes.</p>

<h3 id="water-consumption">
<span class="number">6.3 </span>Water Consumption</h3>
<p>The Agency has installed rainwater harvesting, waterless urinals and low flush toilets across its estate. We will continue good practices such as water auditing, replacing valves where appropriate and monitoring the consumption checking for unusual patterns or possible leaks.</p>

<p>During 2013 to 20-14 we will maintain water consumption to an average of less than 6m3 per person per year in our administrative estate (m3/FTE)  </p>

<h3 id="transparency-commitments">
<span class="number">6.4 </span>Transparency Commitments</h3>
<p>As well as the <a rel="external" href="http://sd.defra.gov.uk/gov/green-government/commitments/">Greening Government Commitments (GGC)</a>, we will be continuing work on our transparency commitments. </p>
