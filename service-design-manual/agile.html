                <p>Agile methodologies will help you and your team to build world-class, user-centred services quickly and affordably. </p>
                <p>This way of working can be very different for those used to long specifications and procurement processes, but it’s essential for producing high-quality services to a standard that many users expect. </p>

                <p>An agile project is about creating fast iterations of products based on the feedback of real users. </p>
                <p>It means regularly releasing small pieces of functionality; constant communication between team members, and using equipment that displays progress being made by your team (eg project management software or whiteboards).</p>

                <p>User understanding is the most important factor when creating a service, so you need to have a clear understanding of what users need and make sure those needs are met. You can achieve this by writing user stories. </p>
                <p>A user story is generally one or more sentences in length and describes: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>who the user is</li>
                  <li>what they need from the service</li>
                  <li>why they need it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These user stories will help your team to produce the required features of your service, and writing them well can make a huge difference to the quality and speed of development.</p>

                <h2 id="main-features-of-agile">Main features of agile</h2>
                <p>Product development during an agile project is broken into different stages, called sprints. </p>
                <p>In a sprint, team members aim to achieve goals within set timeframes. A sprint at GDS generally lasts a week and runs from Wednesday to Tuesday, however other agile development teams may run longer or shorter sprints.</p>
                <p>Have daily team meetings (stand-ups). Stand-ups are an opportunity for members of your team to discuss: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the previous day’s work</li>
                  <li>what they plan to work on</li>
                  <li>any blockers to their progress</li>

                <h2 id="retrospectives">Retrospectives</h2>
                <p>Run retrospectives at the end of each sprint.  A retrospective should cover:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>what went well</li>
                  <li>what went badly</li>
                  <li>how to improve the working environment or process for the next sprint</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Retrospectives can also increase in scope to cover full projects or project phases.</p>

              Making releases boring
              <div class="show-hide continuous-content">
                <p>Continuous delivery is about producing regular iterations of your software that’s ready to be released (deployed), though you don’t have to release these iterations to the public.</p>
                <p>Producing regular iterations makes it easier for you to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>add improvements</li>
                  <li>fix bugs</li>
                  <li>test expectations about your end product</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your software isn’t ready to be used then it’s not creating any real value. Treat it as stock piling up - and stock is waste.</p>
                <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">Lean software development philosophy</a> tells us to:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>Test all iterations of your software, either through public user testing or automated testing (using separate software to perform the testing).</p>
                </blockquote>
                <h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
                <p>Automate your deployment process so you are forced to fully understand it. Then any issues with moving code from your <a href="/service-manual/making-software/version-control.html">version control system</a> into production (when it’s gone live) can be dealt with early on.</p>
                <p>Automating it early also means that code will be tested and any bugs fixed so that <a href="/service-manual/making-software/release-strategies.html">releases become frequent</a>, low-risk, almost boring events.</p>
                <p>Don’t plan production release slots far in advance. You can’t be certain what will be ready in 6 months’ time.</p>
                <p>Make your release planning simpler - make sure it’s flexible enough that any feature or update to your software can be deployed when it’s ready. Then, if a feature needs to miss a release slot, it can easily be rescheduled for tomorrow or next week, rather than in 6 months, or more if the next slot is already full.</p>
                <p>Another advantage is being able to quickly respond to security patches or similar changes in underlying  libraries or frameworks used by your application. You can quickly make a change and watch the update flow through the various gates in your deployment pipeline, confident that nothing has been broken.</p>
                <h2 id="the-deployment-pipeline">The deployment pipeline</h2>
                <p>What happens to code between it being written by a developer and deployed to production is known as the deployment pipeline.</p>
                <p>Understand your end-to-end deployment pipeline. Knowing how it works and how each element works together will have implications for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="/service-manual/making-software/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> (how you maintain consistency with your product’s performance and functionality)</li>
                  <li>the automation of your build, deploy, test and release processes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The deployment pipeline has 4 stages:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>commit stage</li>
                  <li>shared sandbox environment</li>
                  <li>specialist testing environment</li>
                  <li>production environment</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="the-commit-stage">The commit stage</h3>
                <p>When your developer checks into <a href="/service-manual/making-software/version-control.html">version control</a> (where all code, including previous versions, are stored), <a href="/service-manual/making-software/testing-in-agile.html">a range of tests</a> should be run against the latest version of the code. Any quick, easy-to-identify defects, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilation_error">compile errors</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit test failures</a>, will be found at this stage. If the tests pass, the code progresses to the next stage and should be considered for release into production.</p>
                <h3 id="shared-sandbox-environment">Shared sandbox environment</h3>
                <p>Send the code to a shared <a href="/service-manual/making-software/sandbox-and-staging-servers.html">sandbox</a> (testing) environment. This is the first environment where the application is deployed and run. It’s also the first stage where it can be visually inspected for <a href="/service-manual/agile/quality.html">quality</a> by anybody on the team.</p>
                <p>Make the sandbox environment as similar to the production (live) version as far as is practical. For example, if production uses Postgres, the sandbox should also use Postgres and not another database like MySQL or sqlite.</p>
                <p>The purpose is to find any defects in the code. If a defect is found, stop the version of the code at this stage. If it passes the sandbox environment it can move on to further specialist testing environments.</p>
                <h3 id="specialist-testing-environments">Specialist testing environments</h3>
                <p>You may need to perform additional testing for specialist requirements, like <a href="/service-manual/operations/load-and-performance-testing.html">load and performance testing</a>, <a href="/service-manual/operations/penetration-testing.html">penetration testing</a>, or <a href="/service-manual/making-software/accessibility-testing.html">accessibility testing</a>. The amount of environments you’ll need will depend on the requirements and conditions of your individual projects.</p>
                <p>When you are satisfied with the quality of the code, move it to the live production environment.</p>
                <h3 id="production-environment">Production environment</h3>
                <p>Your code is ready to go live if it has passed:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the commit stage</li>
                  <li>the shared sandbox environment</li>
                  <li>any necessary specialist testing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Deploy to production the same way as you deploy to any other environment – use the same scripts, same <a href="/service-manual/making-software/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> tooling, and the same version of the code.  This means you’re not releasing code for the first time – you’re performing a task that’s been validated at each stage throughout the deployment pipeline.</p>

              Sprints, stand-ups and other regular meetings
              <div class="show-hide features-content">
                <p>Some common features of the agile development methods we’ve used at GDS.</p>
                <h2 id="sprints">Sprints</h2>
                <p>Sprints are part of an agile process that uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)">Scrum</a>, a framework for teams developing a product.</p>
                <p>Sprints are about planning what you and your team will achieve and when you will achieve it by. Each member of your team should have a task to complete within each sprint.</p>
                <p>Each sprint is of equal length and usually lasts between 1 to 2 weeks, but you can use longer or shorter sprints in your project.</p>
                <p>When deciding the length of your sprints, consider:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the length of the project – use shorter sprints for shorter projects, giving you greater visibility of what’s going on, the opportunity to iterate and the flexibility to adaptively plan</li>
                  <li>team members that are new to the Scrum process:
                    <ul>
                      <li>shorter sprints means those that are new to Scrum get used to the regular meeting formats and processes faster</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>how often you release code to production  - if it’s only released at the end of each sprint decide how often do you want to ship production-ready code</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Start the process with a sprint 0. This sprint is about preparing your team for the first sprint. Use a sprint 0 to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>get the development and working environments set up</li>
                  <li>agree some of the design principles (technical, product, interaction, content)</li>
                  <li>prepare the product backlog for the first sprint</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While there are other agile methodologies that don’t rely on sprinting, such
                as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)">Kanban</a>, it’s common
                for teams to start with Scrum.</p>
                <h2 id="standard-meetings">Standard meetings</h2>
                <p>Agile processes have 4 different types of regular meetings:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>daily stand-ups</li>
                  <li>sprint planning</li>
                  <li>sprint reviews</li>
                  <li>retrospectives</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="daily-stand-up">Daily stand-up</h3>
                <p>Have daily meetings with your team lasting no more than 15 minutes. It’s best if you do it standing up, in a semicircle, in front of your project wall. This will help you to keep it short and allows your team members to point at user story cards on the wall to keep things on topic.</p>
                <p>Each member of your team should answer:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>what I worked on/produced yesterday</li>
                  <li>what I am working on today (and help I might need)</li>
                  <li>what’s blocking me (ie stopping me from finishing a user story card)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ask people to keep it brief and don’t be afraid to remind them of this. If people try to solve issues during the stand-up, stop the conversation and arrange a huddle after the stand-up to discuss in a smaller group.</p>
                <h3 id="sprint-planning">Sprint planning</h3>
                <p>Sprint planning is done at the start of each sprint. It requires user stories to have been written in advance with acceptance criteria.</p>
                <p>The product owner should read out the stories and explain the acceptance criteria in order of priority. It’s the job of the team to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>understand the story and acceptance criteria</li>
                  <li>agree on the number of user stories they’ll aim to achieve within each sprint</li>
                  <li>agree on the tasks needed to complete it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A good description of sprint planning is on the <a href="http://www.agilelearninglabs.com/resources/scrum-introduction/">Agile Learning Labs website</a>, explaining its 2 parts:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>what we will do?</li>
                  <li>how we will do it?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This meeting can be hard to get right with large teams. Some people want to
                dig deep and question every story; others want to keep moving and don’t want

                <p>Put quality at the forefront of your project if you want people to use and enjoy your service.</p>
                <p>Quality is the responsibility of every member of your team – the people who create the service create the quality of it. Every person on your project should be part of increasing quality and fixing issues.</p>
                <h2 id="defining-quality">Defining quality</h2>
                <p>Quality will mean different things to different members of the team. Fundamentally it is about the experience of the service’s users, from the start to the end of the transaction, which may include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>accessibility for (the widest possible range of) users, across an appropriate range of devices</li>
                  <li>how simple it is to interact with the service</li>
                  <li>the ability of the service provider to quickly provide appropriate support</li>
                  <li>whether the storage and handling of any data is suitable and secure</li>
                  <li>the strength and security of essential software and the infrastructure</li>
                  <li>making sure the <a href="/service-manual/making-software/code-testing.html">code is well-tested</a></li>
                  <li>seeing if it responds quickly when dealing with lots of users at once (<a href="/service-manual/operations/load-and-performance-testing.html">load testing</a>)</li>
                  <li>if it can be scaled rapidly to handle unusual amounts of traffic</li>
                  <li>the ability of the team to quickly add or change features to respond to changing requirements or settings</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="a-note-on-technical-debt">A note on technical debt</h3>
                <p>‘Technical debt’ is a common term in software development, and definitions vary. Generally, technical debt is used to describe compromises made to complete a product’s development, instead of creating a clean, expandable technical design.
                These compromises mean there’s still work to be done, even though the overall product is finished.</p>
                <p>It’s impossible to develop your software without building up some technical debt, so make sure your team have some way of sharing an understanding of the technical debt in their system.</p>
                <p>A large amount of technical debt will slow down future development.  Know how much of it you have and you can prioritise work to reduce it, and can continue to iterate rapidly in the future.</p>
                <h2 id="everyone-is-responsible-for-quality">Everyone is responsible for quality</h2>
                <p>Service quality isn’t just a testing issue or the responsibility of a few individuals. The quality of a system is defined by the people who create it. </p>
                <p>Your team should be able to see any problems in the quality of your system. Every person on the project should be taking action to increase quality and fix issues.</p>
                <h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
                <p>You won’t know how great your product is or if it meets your criteria without testing it – in both normal and unusual conditions.</p>
                <p>Dylan Robert’s book <a href="http://oreil.ly/163ybtz">“Learning From First Responders”</a> is worth reviewing as an example of testing software and teams under unusual stresses (in this case, the final stages of a Presidential campaign).</p>

                <p>The quality of any digital service is the responsibility of the entire team, but the final responsibility lies with the service manager.</p>
                <p>Make sure your service manager works with the rest of your team. Otherwise you risk your team not understanding what measures they need to put in place to guarantee quality.</p>
                <p>Your team will need to consider quality when writing user stories, and allow time and resources to be used for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>testing what is being built</li>
                  <li>doing the basics, so assumptions about accessibility can be regularly tested</li>
                  <li>taking the time to consider failure scenarios and how to respond</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using specialist skills and facilities is a good way to make sure testing is thorough, and is typically used for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="/service-manual/operations/penetration-testing.html">penetration testing</a> - having people outside of the team carry out this task helps challenge assumptions and identify weaknesses, giving a valuable outside perspective</li>
                  <li>hiring quality assurance specialists – they can make sure all quality-related activities are coordinated, and that your team gets the training and resources needed to make a high-quality service by:
                    <ul>
                      <li>having a clear remit and working with your team to build quality into everything they do, instead of just adding a gate review to the development process</li>
                      <li>being a short-term role, leaving your team capable of managing quality as part of their standard development and iteration of your service</li>
                    </ul>

              <div class="show-hide retros-content">
                <p>A central principle of agile is quick feedback loops – you demonstrate something to the user as soon as possible so you can see how well it suits their needs. Retrospectives are the way we apply this to our own teams to find out what’s working and what isn’t, so a team can continuously improve.</p>
                <h2 id="retrospectives">Retrospectives</h2>
                <p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8013/7105598457_084223078e_d.jpg" alt="X-prop retrospective" /></p>
                <p>A retrospective is a meeting at the end of a <a href="/service-manual/agile/features-of-agile.html">sprint</a> where your team get a chance to talk about what went well and badly in that sprint, and take some actions to improve matters. It can also cover a larger scope, eg a full project retrospective.</p>
                <p>A retrospective takes this form:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>gather data</li>
                  <li>generate insights</li>
                  <li>decide what to do</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This is a chance for everyone in your team to contribute to improving process/productivity.</p>
                <h2 id="the-facilitator">The facilitator</h2>
                <p><img src="/service-manual/assets/images/planning_retro.jpg" alt="A retrospective plan" /></p>
                <p>All retrospectives must be facilitated. The facilitator’s role is to give everyone a chance to talk about their concerns and give positive feedback. </p>
                <p>At the same time, they make sure the meeting remains a structured, productive meeting and doesn’t become overly negative. Ideally, your facilitator will be someone outside of your team so your whole team can contribute, but it’s not essential.</p>
                <p>The facilitator needs to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>plan the retrospective</li>
                  <li>make sure that everyone gets a chance to contribute</li>
                  <li>keep the retrospective on track</li>
                  <li>make sure actions are created and assigned</li>
                  <li>manage time so that it does not run over</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="working-agreements">Working agreements</h2>
                <p>You’ll find it helpful to have some working agreements for a retrospective. These can be stated if necessary, eg in the first retrospective your team has.</p>
                <p>Working agreements could be that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>everyone contributes</li>
                  <li>no one speaks over the other (except for the facilitator)</li>
                  <li>no phones or laptops are allowed - everyone should be concentrating on the discussion</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="outcomes-of-a-retrospective">Outcomes of a retrospective</h2>
                <p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8453/8002453131_7fd9489dfd_d.jpg" alt="Retrospective Sections" /></p>
                <p>During the discussion you will uncover some successes you can celebrate, as well as some problems that you can fix or things you can improve.</p>
                <p>Make a list of actions that will address these. Aim to have done them within the next sprint or iteration.</p>
                <p>Some problems may take longer to fix, in which case you should try to make an action that will start the process of improving it by your next retrospective.</p>
                <p>Actions should:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>be concrete and measurable (eg ‘write 10 more unit tests for the redirector’, or ‘speak to Jamie about arranging a project retrospective’; not ‘write more tests’, or ‘we should understand the lessons learned from this project’)</li>
                  <li>have a date by which they should be completed</li>
                  <li>be assigned to a specific person (and not to ‘the team’)</li>
                  <li>not be assigned to someone who is not present</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Retrospectives should follow up on the actions of previous retrospectives to make sure they’ve been completed. If they’re consistently not getting done, you may have too many.</p>
                <h2 id="template">Template</h2>
                <p class="left"><img src="/service-manual/assets/images/redirects.jpeg" alt="Voting with stickers" /></p>
                <p>You can use this template for your retrospectives. It’s based on a team of 8 to 10 and covers a 2-week sprint. 90 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to use for this scope and amount of people.</p>
                <p>Each of the activities is timeboxed (has a set time it will run for), and it’s your facilitator’s job to make sure that your team stick to this.</p>
                <p>Build in about 10% ‘shuffle time’ to move between activities to make sure it doesn’t overrun.</p>
                <h3 id="setting-the-scene-0000-to-0005-5-mins">Setting the scene: 00:00 to 00:05 (5 mins)</h3>
                <p>Explain the scope and, if necessary, purpose. If your team don’t know each other and/or are shy, include brief introductions.</p>
                <h3 id="actions-from-the-previous-retrospective-0005-to-0010-5-mins">Actions from the previous retrospective: 00:05 to 00:10 (5 mins)</h3>
                <p>Make sure they’ve been completed. If any haven’t, ask if:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>they still need to be done</li>
                  <li>why haven’t they been completed - set a new deadline if necessary, but don’t keep carrying actions over</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="left"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8425/7739861570_ef1a5c745f_m_d.jpg" alt="A Bad" /></p>
                <h3 id="the-good-0010-to-0020-10-mins">The good: 00:10 to 00:20 (10 mins)</h3>
                <p>Give your team around 10 minutes to write down all the things that went well in the previous 2 weeks on post-it notes.</p>
                <p>If anonymity is important to encourage free expression, collect them in and add them to the wall yourself. If not, have the team take turns adding their own post-its to the wall, possibly saying a few words about each.</p>
                <p>Don’t allow this to develop into a discussion at this point – you just want to gather data.</p>
                <h3 id="discussion-0020-to-0030-10-mins">Discussion: 00:20 to 00:30 (10 mins)</h3>
                <p>Group the post-its into common themes. If there are too many to discuss in the time you have then have the team prioritise, eg by voting with stickers.</p>
                <p>Discuss each of the main areas in turn:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>what should we keep doing?</li>
                  <li>why did those things go well and what can we learn?</li>
                  <li>are there any actions we can draw out?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="the-bad-0030-to-0045-15-mins">The bad: 00:30 to 00:45 (15 mins)</h3>
                <p>Give the team around 15 minutes to write post-its for anything that went badly.</p>
                <h3 id="discussion-0045-to-0105-20-mins">Discussion: 00:45 to 01:05 (20 mins)</h3>
                <p>Again, group the post-its, prioritise if necessary, and discuss the main areas:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>can we work out why these things went badly?</li>
                  <li>can we work out what we need to do to improve matters, or prevent specific things happening again?</li>
                  <li>can we draw out specific actions that someone here can take that will help?</li>
                </ul>
                <p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8008/7465763890_49469afcfc_z_d.jpg" alt="Post-its" /></p>
                <h3 id="actions-0105-to-0120-15-mins">Actions: 01:05 to 01:20 (15 mins)</h3>
                <p>Spend some time looking at the actions identified; assign them to people present and set realistic deadlines for completion.</p>
                <p>Total: 80 minutes with 10% shuffle time.</p>
                <p>It’s OK to finish early if people have said what they need to. It’s not OK to overrun – if there is too much to say, have the team prioritise the top areas for discussion and/or book more time for the next retrospective.</p>
                <h2 id="why-we-do-this">Why we do this</h2>
                <p>Having a regular retrospective means you can:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>make small improvements often, ideally before problems start to fester</li>
                  <li>identify working practices that make you more efficient, productive or at least happier</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Agile development practices will help you work better, and the retrospective allows you to fine-tune the process and your environment to your needs.</p>

              <div class="show-hide testing-content">
                <p>The basics of any testing approach still apply in the agile world, but the aim of testing can be quite different.</p>
                <p>It’s important to recognise you are testing in the first place to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>build the best quality system you can</li>
                  <li>make sure it does what the customer requires</li>
                  <li>compete it a cost that everyone agrees can be afforded (cost being money, business change, risk etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Too often the aim of testing is to validate what has been produced and nothing else. Your testing should be more about these 7 concepts:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>building quality in</li>
                  <li>everyone is responsible for quality</li>
                  <li>fast feedback</li>
                  <li>tests are an asset of the product</li>
                  <li>faster delivery into production</li>
                  <li>clear and constant view of testing</li>
                  <li>optimise value</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="building-quality-in">Building quality in</h2>
                <p>Use the vast majority of your efforts building quality in at the start, and test the quality throughout the project - not at the end when it’s too late.</p>
                <p>Define acceptance criteria standards for your user stories. You can either do this when you first write your user stories or later on in the form of acceptance tests when you start development work. Testing should confirm what you already know and understand to be true, so there should be no surprises in the latter stages.</p>
                <h2 id="everyone-is-responsible-for-quality">Everyone is responsible for quality</h2>
                <p>Service quality isn’t just a testing issue. The quality of a system is defined by the people who create it.</p>
                <p>Your team should be able to see a problem in the quality of your system. Every person on the project should be taking action to increase quality and fix issues.</p>
                <h2 id="fast-feedback">Fast feedback</h2>
                <p>A successful agile project relies on fast feedback loops. Getting feedback and getting it fast means you can actually be agile and change when you need to change.</p>
                <p>Your testing should be about giving and getting that fast feedback - at a time when it’s useful. <a href="/service-manual/making-software/code-testing">Automated code testing techniques</a> have their place and you can use them, but don’t make them the centre of your approach to testing.</p>
                <h2 id="tests-are-an-asset-of-the-product">Tests are an asset of the product</h2>
                <p>When you build a test, build it to a standard that makes it suitable to use for testing multiple times throughout your project.</p>
                <p>It takes a lot of effort to do testing correctly, so don’t make it a throwaway exercise that has to start from scratch each time there’s a new release, or a new project.</p>
                <p>Write your automated tests with the same care and accuracy as production code.</p>
                <h2 id="faster-delivery-into-production">Faster delivery into production</h2>
                <p>Testing is necessary and valuable to the programme, but the time it takes for your code to go live once written is time wasted.</p>
                <p>Use testing to get the fastest possible confirmation that everything is as you expect - or that it isn’t and needs to be fixed.</p>
                <p>It doesn’t always need to be exhaustive at every level, but it does need to be relevant to the current situation. Your team needs to agree on the necessary testing at each level, based on the preferences of the product owner and the likelihood of risk in the application itself.</p>
                <h2 id="clear-and-consistent-view-of-testing">Clear and consistent view of testing</h2>
                <p>Everybody in your programme needs to understand and agree on:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the approach to testing</li>
                  <li>where they fit in</li>
                  <li>what they’re required to do</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="optimise-value">Optimise value</h2>
                <p>When done well, testing will inform you of the best way forward. It’ll also give you the best value in terms of effort used in various functional or nonfunctional areas and will:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>help make the tough decisions</li>
                  <li>direct development based on the risk of each user story</li>
                  <li>help with the order of priority, based on the complexity of the system</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="types-of-testing">Types of testing</h2>
                <p>The most noticeable difference with testing in an agile project is that the majority of your test efforts will be centred on automated tests. </p>
                <p>These tests run in continuous integration, which means that they form part of your codebase - every time you make a change to your code, your tests are automatically run. You’ll get immediate feedback on the quality of your code and it’ll help to prevent bugs happening at a later stage (when they’re expensive and complicated to resolve.)</p>

                <h3 id="exploratory-testing">Exploratory testing</h3>
                <p>Exploratory  testing is a term commonly used to describe unscripted manual testing. This is where the tester uses his or her knowledge, experience and intuition to go through through the software and identify bugs.</p>
                <p>The difference between unscripted and scripted tests is that a scripted test can only ever test a predetermined outcome. Exploratory testing (unscripted) doesn’t mean you don’t prepare for the testing.</p>
                <p>Exploratory testing is:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>always planned in advance, in detail, including:
                    <ul>
                      <li>the specific aspects you want to explore</li>
                      <li>any need for extra data or a different system set-up to perform the testing</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>used to find and test the less obvious outcomes (automated tests prevent bugs whereas exploratory tests find them)</li>
                  <li>normally timeboxed (runs for a fixed period of time)</li>
                  <li>has a specific purpose - eg ‘I will spend x hours exploring y and z aspects of the system (though this may take me elsewhere and it may take more or less time, so I’ll use my judgement as I go)’</li>
                  <li>not always without automation – automation can be used to set up the data or to get a set of transactions (just not to run the tests)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The quality analysts or testers in your team carry out this type of testing. If your team is made up of only developers, you’ll need to put time aside for the developers to do the testing, but bear in mind that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>as developers are deeply involved in writing the code, it’s sometime difficult for them to see ways through the system that they hadn’t previously thought of</li>
                  <li>it’s ideal for developers to be assigned to exploratory testing for a full day to allow the appropriate amount of context switching (the way a central processing unit changes from one task to another without the tasks conflicting)</li>
                  <li>it’s preferable if they explore parts of the system that they haven’t really developed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When a manual test finds a defect, it’s important to always add an automated test to stop it from happening again.</p>

                <h3 id="crowdsourced-testing">Crowdsourced testing</h3>
                <p>Crowdsourced testing doesn’t use a set group of people to carry out testing (known as outsource testing). It uses different people from different places in different jobs. It’s a good way of speeding up your manual testing and/or covering more ground.</p>
                <p>There are external companies who provide this as a service, but GDS do it internally by:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>putting out a call for as many volunteers as possible across the organisation to put aside a few hours on a particular day for testing</li>
                  <li>giving some guidance on what needs to be tested</li>
                  <li>providing somewhere to log bugs</li>
                  <li>sometimes motivating testers by creating a ‘leaderboard’ that shows who’s tested the most things</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples of where GDS used this effectively include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the pre-release testing of additional devices/browsers</li>
                  <li>the detailed checking of hundreds of pieces of content on GOV.UK against old content on DirectGov and BusinessLink</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="test-your-ideas">Test your ideas</h3>
                <p>Don’t forget, don’t just test the product itself - test your ideas.   For information on how to do this read <a href="/service-manual/user-centered-design/introduction-to-user-research.html">the guidance about user research</a>.</p>

              Common features of agile projects
              <div class="show-hide looks-content">
                <p>Agile can be a liberating way of working. It won’t stop you from using existing skills and knowledge, but it will require your team, users and stakeholders to start working together in new ways.</p>
                <h2 id="understand-your-users">Understand your users</h2>
                <p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7177/6987029385_410a1c8d26.jpg" alt="Real people will use your product" /></p>
                <p>Prioritise features for users over everyone else – including your big, scary stakeholders - and ask for their feedback early and often. Really listen to your users. Even when they tell you things you don’t want to hear or disagree with.</p>
                <p>If possible, use data from real people that are using your product and let it influence the direction of your project. Constantly put users first.</p>
                <h2 id="what-do-you-want-next-friday-what-have-we-learned-last-week">“What do you want next Friday? What have we learned last week?”</h2>
                <!--p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8043/8100964765_acf4032d09.jpg" alt="A sprint backlog, courtesy of http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/" /></p-->
                <p>Iterate often. Build something that strives to achieve the most valuable user need and show it to the users, listen to their feedback and improve it. Keep doing this until you have something so useful that they wouldn’t be without it.</p>
                <p>It might sound like over-simplifying the complexity of software development and project management, but agile development is all about “what do you want by next Friday?”</p>
                <p>The process of producing incremental, production-ready software allows your team to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>give value to their users and stakeholders regularly</li>
                  <li>shorten feedback loops that could be longer if using a waterfall methodology (where you only move on to the next phase when the phase you’re working on is complete)</li>
                  <li>think about what features are the next most important to produce</li>
                  <li>direct their efforts on creating useable software</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Run a <a href="/service-manual/agile/running-retrospectives.html">retrospective</a> at the end of each delivery cycle or <a href="/service-manual/agile/features-of-agile.html">sprint</a> to review what worked or what could be improved.</p>
                <p>Your team will continue to learn through delivery cycles and improve throughout the project.</p>
                <h2 id="small-agile-teams">Small, agile teams</h2>
                <p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8374/8451589322_e9f612cf5b.jpg" alt="The unit of delivery is the team" /></p>
                <p>Small teams of between 5 to 10 people are often more productive and predictable than larger teams. Forget man-days (the amount of work produced by an average worker in a day) and think about your team as a unit.</p>
                <p>A good team includes members with all of the skills necessary to successfully produce software. A fully functioning team has 3 main roles:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>product manager – a role probably performed by the <a href="/service-manual/the-team/service-manager.html">Service manager</a>) responsible for delivering return on investment, usually by creating products that users love</li>
                  <li><a href="/service-manual/the-team/delivery-manager.html">delivery manager</a> (aka Scrum master or project manager) – the agile expert responsible for removing blockers (things slowing a team down), they also act as a facilitator at team meetings</li>
                  <li><a href="/service-manual/the-team/index.html">team members</a> – self-organising and multi-disciplinary, they produce user stories, carry out the product manager’s vision and are responsible for estimating their output and speed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Encourage your team members to pair up, as working together is beneficial. 2 people working on 1 thing will:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>produce better software solutions</li>
                  <li>encourage better quality controls</li>
                  <li>spread knowledge across the team</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A good team means you’re able to estimate your output, or speed, very effectively and consistently. You can then plan much more accurately.</p>
                <h2 id="fail-fast">Fail fast</h2>
                <p><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7189/6875228285_9b2409663f.jpg" alt="Failing, so fix it!" /></p>
                <p>Regularly releasing little pieces of code will:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>improve quality</li>
                  <li>improve visibility</li>
                  <li>reduce cost to market</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Agile techniques don’t guarantee success - you can still fail!</p>
                <p>But these techniques do allow you to spot problems earlier on and resolve them. You can resolve issues, and stop issues from happening, by:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>releasing working software to your users regularly – it allows you to get feedback quickly and hear or see what they think; if the product is wrong you can easily change direction and iterate</li>
                  <li>demonstrating value to your sponsor with regular releases - if your software is rarely released you run the risk of creating a ‘too-big-to-fail’ service that shouldn’t be released, but must be released anyway </li>
                  <li>checking your teams’ progress - if your teams’ speed is still inconsistent after the initial 4 to 6 sprints, then something needs fixing (possibly unknown complications or poor estimation with timings)</li>
                  <li>using test-driven development (writing tests before you develop the features to be tested) to highlight issues with quality early on - establish the issues, baseline metrics, and monitor throughout the project</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Don’t be afraid to fail or experiment. Learn to fail, and create a culture that learns from failure.</p>
                <h2 id="continuous-planning">Continuous planning</h2>
                <p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8001/7113823877_80c4dfb613.jpg" alt="Planning session" /></p>
                <p>It’s a myth that you don’t plan on agile projects.  The freedom of agile projects does not come free: you have to plan. You just plan differently and continuously.</p>
                <p>Base your agile planning on solid, historical data, not theories or opinions. Your plan must continuously demonstrate its accuracy: nobody on your agile project should take it for granted that the plan is workable.</p>
                <p>Your teams should plan together, on at least 2 levels:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>release level - identify and prioritise the features you must have, and would like to have by the deadline</li>
                  <li>iteration level - plan for the next features to implement, in priority order (if features are too large to be estimated or delivered within a single iteration, break them down further)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Review these plans after every sprint and adjust them based on:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the progress of the previous sprint</li>
                  <li>any new facts and requirements</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="common-situations-to-look-out-for">Common situations to look out for</h2>
                <p><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8424/7503675672_72ff8a1fa9.jpg" alt="Do go here!" /></p>
                <p>If your team is new to agile, be wary of familiar situations and reactions from having to do things differently. These situations have a bad smell about them and will undermine your project and its chances of success:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>your core team isn’t full-time or is working on multiple projects - your team is the unit of delivery and you need 100%, so push back on managers and stakeholders if this is happening</li>
                  <li>you don’t have a dedicated team area – sit your team together, preferably in your own room, with space on the walls to draw ideas and stick up cards and post-its
                    <ul>
                      <li>rearrange your workspace or use tools in innovative ways to improve your teams’ working environment and increase productivity - you’ll challenge some longstanding working practices, but this is very important</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>there’s no continuous integration/development environment - if your teams aren’t insisting on this from the beginning you’ve probably got the wrong team:
                    <ul>
                      <li>iterative software development is, in many areas, dependent on the ability to continuously deploy and run automated tests</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>you have a separate quality assurance (<abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr>) department – if your team pass software they’ve developed over to a <abbr title="quality assurance">QA</abbr> department, they’ve got the wrong attitude to delivering production-ready software; embed a quality culture into the team</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is by no means a complete list, but these are most common things to watch out for.</p>

              How to write a useful user story
              <div class="show-hide stories-content">
                <p>A user story briefly explains:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>the person using the service (actor)</li>
                  <li>what the user needs the service for (narrative)</li>
                  <li>why the user needs it (goal)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>User stories are an essential part of the agile toolkit. They’re a way of organising your work into manageable chunks that create tangible value, and can be discussed and prioritised independently.</p>
                <p>User stories are a technique which relies on other agile practices, including continuous delivery, and face-to-face communication with user representatives. It’s not sufficient to simply ‘set’ a user representative: that user representative needs to be in the same place as the team and available to the team a sufficient amount of time.</p>
                <p>User stories can be added to a product backlog at any point in the sprint cycle by any person in the team. It’s up to the product owner to coordinate and prioritise them, and to select stories for each sprint at the start of each sprint cycle.</p>
                <p>Discuss the stories ahead of sprint planning with:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>relevant team members</li>
                  <li>subject matter experts</li>
                  <li>stakeholders</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="user-story-cards">User story cards</h2>
                <p class="left"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8372/8358344190_f48b88c254_n.jpg" alt="A user story index card" /></p>
                <p>A user story is represented through a story card that has a title and a few lines of text.</p>
                <p>Your story cards can be virtual, as well as actual cards. On a large product/service keep your stories in a digital format, and then turn them into physical cards as part of sprint planning.</p>
                <p>When writing a user story, make sure the story is well-formed. Don’t skip the part explaining why there’s a need for a service just because it can be difficult.</p>
                <p>You might want to include a list of acceptance criteria. These should be an aide-memoire for things to test or check which may have come up during conversation, but they should not be used as a way of defining the scope of a story.</p>
                <p>If stories are too big then split them into smaller stories as they stand more chance of producing shippable (ready to use) code.</p>
                <h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
                <p>Story cards follow a standard structure:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>title</li>
                  <li>actor</li>
                  <li>narrative</li>
                  <li>goal</li>
                </ul>
                <p>They don’t capture every detail, but you should have a more in-depth discussion about a user story at the appropriate time.</p>

                <p>Building useful software systems is hard, so you need to make sure you’re solving the right problem.</p>
                <p>Agile methodologies emphasise an outside-in approach – what outcome is your service user trying to achieve? If you dive into the solution without a good understanding of your users, you risk solving the wrong problem, or coming up with solutions which don’t really work for your users in the real world. That’s why the most important part of a user story is the goal.</p>
                <h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
                <p>Use this to help you decide whether the story is “done” or delivered, ie does the work meet the goal of the user?</p>
                <p>When writing stories with your development team, always start by thinking about and discussing your users’ goals:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>why do they want to use your service?</li>
                  <li>what are they trying to achieve?</li>
                  <li>what need has motivated them to seek out your service?</li>
                  <li>in what context do they use it - at home/work/on a mobile phone/whilst caring for a child?</li>
                  <li>how often do they use it?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Suzanne and James Robertson have excellent advice on this in the book <em>Mastering the Requirements Process</em> (3rd edition).</p>
                <h3 id="actor">Actor</h3>
                <p>Being specific about the actor will help you to break down interactions into logical chunks.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the actor will be a user of your service, or the actor will be an administrator, technician or manager in your organisation.</p>
                <p>Make sure you already have a good understanding of your users from your initial project work or existing research. If not, take the time to develop that understanding.</p>
                <h3 id="narrative">Narrative</h3>
                <p>Use this as a reminder of the main interaction that needs to be addressed as part of the user experience. Remember that the story card does not need to spell out every detail.</p>
                <h2 id="taking-a-rain-check--the-promise-of-a-conversation">Taking a rain check – the promise of a conversation</h2>
                <p><a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">Agile teams prefer face-to-face conversation over detailed documentation</a>.</p>
                <p>Face-to-face is:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>faster</li>
                  <li>more accurate than written documentation</li>
                  <li>allows developers to build up a detailed mental model of the user goals, workflows, constraints, and the many issues which must be taken into account when building a software system</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The story card is just a placeholder, a promise to have a conversation when the time is right. Use the story card and some brief initial conversations to estimate the amount of time a story needs to be completed and then put it into an agile backlog.</p>
                <p>When development work actually starts, consult the users or user representative to fill out the story details. A user story is the sum of all of these conversations, sketches and whiteboard diagrams - not just the card. You don’t need to write down or archive your conversations, but translate them directly into automated tests and working code.</p>
                <p>Using user stories in this way allows you to avoid ‘analysis paralysis’, the painful condition of trying to guess the details of some far-future goal.</p>
                <h2 id="acceptance-criteria-in-user-stories">Acceptance criteria in user stories</h2>
                <p>Acceptance criteria can be used to determine when a story is done. These follow a conversation between developer and user or user representative and are considered before coding begins.</p>
                <p>Only include these on the back of the story card if the team finds them useful for recording user assumptions they might later forget. Sometimes writing acceptance criteria on the story card is useful where the user or user representative is not immediately available but is no substitute at all for face-to-face conversation.</p>
                <h2 id="stories-only-work-in-an-agile-team">Stories only work in an agile team</h2>
                <p>The success of a user story is dependent on regular face-to-face communication between developers and users or user representatives.</p>
                <p>Your service manager and other user representatives need to be available to developers every day, and have enough time to think through and answer questions. Don’t underestimate how time-consuming this work can be!</p>
                <h2 id="how-to-get-user-stories">How to get user stories</h2>
                <p>Stories can come from many places, but the most common sources include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>story writing workshops - more commonly at the start of a project, the development team and stakeholders will get together to write stories</li>
                  <li>user interviews with real users - ideally, you will set up a user panel which the development team have ongoing access to</li>
                  <li>user representatives embedded within your team - this may include the service manager or product owner</li>
                  <li>observation - watch real users using your service</li>
                </ul>
