              <p>The user flow through the registration screens will depend whether or not the user is doing this for the first
                time, or returning.</p>

              <p>I'd like to avoid exposing people to the 'Hub'page wherever possible. Most people will be completing a single LPA
                and will not be expecting a 'dashboard' style interface for managing multiple LPAs.</p>

              <p>As a rule, people should only see the 'hub' page if they have signed in to the website by clicking on a 'sign in' link on the website.</p>

              <p>If they've followed a link in an email relating to the creation or registration of a specific LPA, they should bypass the hub.</p>

              <p>So, if a user clicks on a link in the email that was sent when an LPA was <em>created</em> they should be taken straight
                to the <a href="6.Register-confirm-LPA.html">Confirm LPA</a> page.</p>

              <p>Likewise, if the user is on the site for the first time and has just created an account, the link in the verification email should take them straight into the <a href="2.Create-enter-details.html">Create an LPA</a> process.</p>

              <h2>Front end development</h2>
              <p>As the main objective of the prototype was to communicate design decisions to the dev team it's an unholy mixture of 'proper' code and 'just make it look right' type stuff. It'll all need refactoring at some point - I'd suggest we do this across a bunch of transaction products at the same time to come up with a consistent code base. Perhaps something for Aug/Sep?</p>

              <p>I've made liberal use of <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> tags. Support for these tags is patchy in earlier browsers, but polyfills are available, so we should implement one. Also, there may be issue with keyboard accessibility that need to be addressed.</p>

              <p>I've used Twitter Bootstrap as the basis for the HTML forms markup. The CSS contains a stripped-down and tweaked version of the forms CSS from Bootstrap. This is less about inheriting the bootstrap style, more about establishing an agreed convention for marking up form layouts.</p>

              <p>One of the forms patterns needs a little work. It's the one where you select a radio/checkbox and it reveals a text box. The toggling behaviour is inconsistent at the moment.</p>




              <br />
              <h2>Other stuff</h2>
              <h3>Form Thumbnails</h3>
              <p><a href="Axure screens/LPA_Thumbnails.html" title="View LPA thumbnails here">View here</a><p>

              <p>The plan is to use these thumbnails throughout the interface to reiforce the idea that the user is creating
                a printable document, that will look nothing like the website they're using.</p>

              <p>In particular, these thumbnails should feature in the sections relating to parts of the form that people
                need to sign - Donor, Attorney and Cerificate Provider.</p>
