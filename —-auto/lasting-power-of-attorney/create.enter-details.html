        <details class="intro" open>
          <summary>What is a lasting power of attorney?</summary>
          <p>A lasting power of attorney ("LPA") is a powerful legal document that allows you (the "donor") to choose other people (your "attorneys") to make decisions on your behalf if you lose the 
          <span title="'Mental capacity' is the ability to make a decision. A person with mental capacity has a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it and the likely consequences of the decision." style="text-decoration:underline;cursor:pointer">mental capacity</span> 
          to make those decisions for yourself.</p>
          <p>An LPA helps you keep control over decisions that affect you, even when you cannot make them personally. An LPA allows you to plan in advance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>what decisions you want to be made on your behalf</li>
            <li>who you want to make those decisions</li>
            <li>how you want them to make those decisions.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What does a lasting power of attorney cover?</summary>
          <strong>There are two types of lasting power of attorney:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Property and financial affairs</strong>: this covers all aspects of your life where money or other property is involved. You do not have to own your own home or have a lot of money for a property and financial affairs LPA to be relevant to you.</li>
            <li><strong>Health and welfare</strong>: this covers all aspects of your medical, physical and personal care. It also lets you give your attorneys power to make decisions about treatment to keep you alive or, alternatively, to make sure that your doctors will be responsible for those decisions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may choose to make only one or both. There is more detail about the two types of LPA in Question 1, where you will choose which LPA to make.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How do your attorneys make decisions on your behalf?</summary>
          <p>The people you choose as your attorneys to make decisions on your behalf must always act in your best interest and they must follow any instructions you give them about how they make decisions.</p>
          <p>These instructions can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>whether they make all or some decisions on their own or together</li>
            <li>any restrictions or conditions you impose on how they make decisions</li>
            <li>any guidance you include about how you would like them to make decisions so that their decisions will be similar to the ones you would have made yourself.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Your attorneys can only make decisions that they are authorised to make under your LPA. For example, if your LPA relates to your property and financial affairs, they cannot make decisions about your care or where you live. They must also follow certain principles when they act on your behalf under and LPA and they may be held accountable if they do not perform their duties properly.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>What happens next?</summary>
          <p>You will work through a series of questions in this tool. Each question has a brief description of the information you need to enter or the choices you need to make and also has a link to more detailed help and guidance including factsheets to help you (the donor), your attorneys and your certificate provider understand your roles.</p>
          <p>You can stop at any time and save the information you have entered so far. You may want to do that if you need to think about a decision, read a factsheet or discuss the LPA with someone.</p>
          <p>Make sure you have access to a printer as you will need to print out the completed LPA document so that the relevant people involved can sign it. An LPA cannot be fully created and completed online. The law provides that it must be a paper document with hand-written signatures.</p>

        <details open class="intro">
          <summary>Overview</summary>
          <p>There are two types of lasting power of attorney.  You may choose to make only one of them or both. An LPA must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian before it can be used.</p>
          <h3>Property and financial affairs</h3>
          <p>This covers all aspects of your life where money or other property is involved. You do not have to own your own home or have a lot of money for a property and financial affairs LPA to be relevant to you. For example, you will probably need someone to pay your gas bill or collect your pension for you when you become unable to do these things for yourself.</p>
          <h3>Health and welfare</h3>
          <p>This covers all aspects of your medical, physical and personal care. It also lets you give your attorneys power to make decisions about treatment to keep you alive or, alternatively, to make sure that your doctors will be responsible for those decisions.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How does a property and financial affairs LPA work?</summary>
          <p>You choose someone to make decisions on your behalf about things like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>opening, closing and operating bank/building society accounts</li>
            <li>claiming, receiving and using your benefits, pensions and allowances</li>
            <li>paying household and other bills</li>
            <li>buying and selling your house and other property.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can also make a property and financial affairs LPA to allow someone to make decisions about your business affairs.</p>
          <p>Your attorneys can use a property and financial affairs LPA to make decisions as soon as it is registered. This can be useful to help you cope with your affairs while you still have mental capacity but for some other reason you find it difficult or impractical.</p>    
          <p>If you do not want the property and financial affairs LPA to be used until you lose mental capacity to make decisions, you will have the opportunity to choose that option in Question 3.</p>    
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How does a health and welfare LPA work?</summary>
          <p>You choose someone to make decisions on your behalf about things like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>giving or refusing consent to particular types of healthcare, including medical treatments</li>
            <li>you staying in your own home, perhaps with help and support from social services</li>
            <li>you moving into residential care and choosing the right care home for you</li>
            <li>day-to-day issues such as your diet, dress or daily routine.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You must also choose whether the person you appoint is allowed to make decisions about treatment necessary to keep you alive (this is called "life-sustaining treatment"), or whether you prefer that decision to be made by doctors.</p>
          <p>Your attorneys can only use a health and welfare LPA when you lose the mental capacity to make decisions. This is an important safeguard for you.</p>    
        </details>    
        <details>
          <summary>Are there other ways to plan for your health and welfare?</summary>
          <p>There are other ways to make your views known so as to help people make health and welfare decisions on your behalf.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can <strong>write a statement of your preferences</strong> and wishes. This is not legally binding but the people looking after you would have to take your stated views into account as part of any decision about your best interests.</li>
            <li>You can <strong>create a care plan</strong> if you receive health or social care services.  This is a written document stating the type (and frequency) of long-term care services.</li>
            <li>You can <strong>make an advance decision to refuse treatment</strong>. This is a legally-binding document that allows you to specify particular types of treatment that you don't want to receive (in case you lose the capacity to make this decision for yourself at some point).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you make an advance decision to refuse treatment and then later make a health and welfare LPA, your advance decision will become invalid. If you have already made an advance decision, then before you make the LPA you may want to seek advice from someone with relevant experience, such as a health professional, a social care professional, a patient support group or other experienced organisation.</p>
        </details>    
        <details>
          <summary>Why should you register your LPA?</summary>
          <p>Your attorneys can only use your LPA to make decisions on your behalf after it has been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian.</p>
          <p>You do not have to register an LPA as soon as it has been completed, but it is a good idea to register it early in case it contains any errors that you need to correct. If this happens you may have to make all or part of the LPA again, and you can only do that if you still have mental capacity.</p>
          <p>If your attorneys apply to register the form after you have lost mental capacity, then it will not be possible for you to correct any errors and the LPA will not be registered and cannot be used. Your attorneys (or someone else) will have to apply to the Court of Protection to get the power to make decisions on your behalf. This can be a long and very expensive process.</p>

        <details class="intro" open>
            <summary>When does a property and finance LPA take effect?</summary>
          <p>A property and finance LPA takes effect as soon as it is registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. However attorneys cannot use the LPA to make decisions on your behalf unless you agree. While you still have the capacity to make decisions you can choose whether your attorneys should act on your behalf and in what circumstances.</p>
          <p>It is a good idea to register an LPA as soon as possible in case it contains any errors that you need to correct. If this happens you may have to make all or part of the LPA again, and you can only do that if you still have mental capacity. If you want the security of having registered the LPA but don't want your attorneys to use it immediately, you can choose to do that.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Why choose "as soon as it is registered"?</summary>
          <p>You should choose this option if either:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>you want your attorneys to be able to act under the LPA as soon as it is registered, or</li>
            <li>although you do not want your attorneys to act immediately, you do want the security of having the LPA ready to be used in case you lack mental capacity in the future.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many donors find it useful to have their attorneys help them cope with their affairs while they still have mental capacity but for some other reason find it difficult or impractical. For example, if you have a disability and find it hard to get out and about, or to communicate with your bank, gas supplier etc, you might want your attorneys to help you.</p>
          <p>As long as you have capacity to make decisions yourself, you have control over all decisions about your property and financial affairs. You can agree with your attorneys that they can make certain decisions for you. For example you may ask them to pay bills and deal with the bank, but not allow them to make decisions about selling your house. Alternatively you can choose not to allow them to use the LPA at all while you can still make decisions for yourself.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Why choose "when I lose mental capacity"?</summary>
          <p>Choose this option if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>you do not want or need your attorneys to make decisions on your behalf while you are able to make decisions for yourself, and</li>
            <li>you want the security of having the LPA ready to be used in case you lack mental capacity in the future.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>"Mental capacity" is the ability to understand a decision that you need to make, why you need to make it and the likely consequences of the decision.</p>
          <p>If you choose this option, the following words will appear on the printed LPA document under the "Restrictions and conditions" heading: "This lasting power of attorney will take effect only when I lose capacity to make decisions about my property and financial affairs."</p>
          <p>You can change the wording to include more detailed instructions if you prefer. Some people find it helpful to set out how their mental capacity should be assessed. For example you might say:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>My attorneys shall only act under this power if they have obtained a written medical opinion stating that I am no longer mentally capable of managing and administering my property and financial affairs.</li>
            <li>This lasting power of attorney only applies if my GP or another doctor confirms in writing that I lack capacity to make specific decisions about property or finances.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Alternatively you may trust your attorneys to carry out a good assessment of your mental capacity, in which case you do not need to change the wording.</p>
          <p><strong>Note</strong>: Banks and other financial institutions sometimes wish to see written confirmation of a donor's lack of mental capacity before recognising an attorney's authority to act under the LPA.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Restrictions on your attorneys' decisions:</summary>
          <p>
          In Question 7 you can set restrictions on the decisions your attorneys can make about life-sustaining treatment. You could specify certain medical or physical conditions where your attorneys must or must not consent to life-sustaining treatment on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
          An example of a useful restriction would be to state that your attorneys must not consent to life-sustaining if you are in a persistent vegetative state.

          <p>The donor is the person making the lasting power of attorney.</p>
          <p>As the donor you can have help with creating your LPA using this tool (or by other means) but you are the only person who can give other people the power to make decisions on your behalf.</p>
        </details>    
        <details>
          <summary>Who can make an LPA?</summary>
          <p>You can make an LPA if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You are an individual,</li>
            <li>you are over 18 years old, and</li>
            <li>you have the mental capacity to do so.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are bankrupt you can make and sign a property and finance LPA, but you may not be able to register it. If you become bankrupt after the LPA is registered it may be revoked. If you are currently bankrupt you should seek legal advice about making a property and finance LPA. (Bankruptcy does not affect a health and welfare LPA).</p>

          <summary>What is mental capacity?</summary>
          <p>"Mental capacity" is the ability to make a decision. A person with mental capacity has a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it and the likely consequences of the decision.</p>

        <details>
          <summary>What if you live or have property abroad?</summary>
          <p>LPAs cover people who live or have assets in England and Wales. An LPA made here may not be usable in any other country, including Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> 
          <p>
          You should seek legal advice about making an LPA if:</p>
          <ul>

        <details open class="intro">
          <summary>What is an attorney?</summary>
          <p>An attorney is a person you appoint under the LPA to make decisions on your behalf.  The word "attorney" means a person appointed to act on behalf of someone in legal matters. It does not mean a solicitor and you <strong>do not</strong> have to choose a solicitor to act as an attorney.</p>
        </details>   
        <details>
          <summary>Who can be an attorney?</summary>
          <p>Anyone aged 18 or over can be an attorney, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>your spouse, partner or civil partner</li>
            <li>a member of your family</li>
            <li>a close friend</li>
            <li>a professional (eg a solicitor).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>An attorney for a health and welfare LPA must be an individual. If you appoint a professional attorney (eg a solicitor) for a property and finance LPA you must name an individual - you cannot simply specify a job title or the firm as a whole.</p>
          <p>An attorney for a property and finance LPA can also be a trust corporation. These are generally appointed for complex legal affairs. (See more detail below.)</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you appoint your spouse or civil partner and your relationship is legally ended, then your LPA will become unusable unless:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>you include a condition in Question 7 (restrictions and guidance for attorneys) that they can continue to act as your attorney, or</li>
            <li>you appoint a replacement attorney in Question 5, or</li>
            <li>you have appointed more than one attorney and authorised them to make decisions jointly and severally in Question 6 (how attorneys work together to make decisions).</li>
          </ul>
        </details>        
        <details>
          <summary>Who can NOT be an attorney?</summary>
          <p>A person who lacks mental capacity cannot be an attorney.</p>
          <p>An undischarged bankrupt cannot be an attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA. If the attorney becomes bankrupt after the LPA has been registered, they will no longer be able to act as your attorney. (Bankruptcy is not relevant for a health and welfare LPA.)</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>When can an attorney make decisions under an LPA?</summary>
          <p>There are different rules about when an attorney can make decisions under an LPA. These depend on the type of LPA and whether you have mental capacity to make decisions for yourself.</p>
          <p>"Mental capacity" is the ability to make a decision. A person with mental capacity has a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it and the likely consequences of the decision.</p>
          
          <h3>Property and financial affairs LPA:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you <strong>have mental capacity</strong> when the LPA is registered, your attorneys can only use the LPA to make decisions on your behalf if you agree. While you still have the capacity to make decisions you can choose whether your attorneys should act on your behalf and in what circumstances.</li>
            <li>If you <strong>do not have mental capacity</strong> when the LPA is registered, your attorneys can make decisions under the LPA immediately.</li>
            <li>If you <strong>lose mental capacity</strong> after the LPA is registered, your attorneys can begin making decisions on your behalf at that time.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Health and welfare LPA:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you <strong>have mental capacity</strong> when the LPA is registered, your attorneys cannot use the LPA to make decisions on your behalf. They can only make decisions when you lose mental capacity.</li>
            <li>If you <strong>do not have mental capacity</strong> when the LPA is registered, your attorneys can make decisions under the LPA immediately.</li>
            <li>If you <strong>lose mental capacity</strong> after the LPA is registered, your attorneys can begin making decisions on your behalf at that time.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
          In any case, an attorney can only make decisions under an LPA after it has been registered by the Office of the Public Guardian.

        </details>       
        <details>
          <summary>What happens if an attorney cannot act on your behalf?</summary>
          <p>If your attorneys have been acting on your behalf under the LPA but, for some reason, they cannot continue to act (for example if they die), then the LPA may no longer be workable. It is a good idea to appoint one or more replacement attorneys to take over from the original attorneys if this happens so that the LPA can continue to be used. You can appoint replacement attorneys in Question 5 of this tool.</p>
        </details>     
        <details>
          <summary>What is a trust corporation?</summary>
          <p>
          A trust corporation is an organisation that manages your funds (savings, pensions, investments, etc) based on a set of objectives and criteria approved by you. A trust corporation is usually run by a commercial bank. People generally appoint a trust corporation where their financial affairs are particularly complicated. If you are considering appointing a trust corporation you should seek professional legal or financial advice.
          </p>
          <p>
          You do not have to appoint a trust corporation as your attorney, but if you do then you must not appoint more than one. You can only appoint trust corporations as either your attorney or your replacement attorney, but not both.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you appoint a trust corporation, please make sure you ask them for the exact name they operate under.

        <details open class="intro">
          <summary>What is a replacement attorney?</summary>
          <p>A replacement attorney is someone you choose to step in if, for some reason, one or more of your attorneys might not be able to make decisions for you. This could be because:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>your attorney dies, or</li>
          <li>your attorney loses mental capacity, or</li>
          <li>your attorney decides they do not want to act for you anymore.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          If you have appointed only one attorney, then your LPA will no longer work. Even if you have appointed more than one attorney, there is still a risk that part or all of your LPA will not work. In either situation the remaining attorneys, or someone else connected with you, may have to apply to the Court of Protection to get power to act on your behalf. This can be a long and expensive process.
          </p>
          <p>
          But, if you appoint one or more replacement attorneys, then the LPA will continue to be usable because the replacement attorneys can make decisions under the LPA.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>When can a replacement attorney start acting?</summary>
          <p>
          A replacement attorney can only act under the LPA if the original attorney they are replacing is permanently unable to make decisions for you for one of the reasons mentioned above.
          </p>
          You <strong>cannot</strong> appoint a replacement attorney:
          <ul>
          <li>to stand in for another attorney when they are still able to act but are temporarily unavailable (eg on holiday), or</li>
          <li>to replace a replacement attorney.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          Replacement attorneys usually step in as soon as the first of your original attorneys ceases to act for you. If you appoint more than one replacement attorney, they will all step in at that time. If this is not what you want, then you must also specify the order in which they will replace the original attorneys.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Examples of replacement attorneys</summary>
          <ul>
          <li>You choose your spouse as your attorney. You appoint your son or daughter as a replacement attorney in case your spouse dies.</li>
          <li>You choose two attorneys. You appoint a replacement attorney who can step in and work with one of the attorneys if the other one dies.</li>
          <li>You choose your spouse and child as your attorney. You appoint your grandchildren as replacements.</li>

          <p>A "certificate provider" is an independent person who must be able to confirm that
there is nothing to be concerned about when you are making the LPA. They help
ensure that your LPA is right for you. They are an important safeguard in making

The certificate provider must confirm that:</p>

            <li>you understand the significance of the LPA,</li>
            <li>you have not been put under pressure by anyone else to make it,</li>

          </ul>
              <p>
              <strong>Someone who has known you well</strong>: If you want to choose someone who has
known you well for at least two years, you might consider asking a friend or
neighbour, someone you know at a social or sports club, a work colleague, etc.
They have to know you well enough to have an honest conversation with you about
making your LPA and to be able to satisfy themselves about the things they have to
confirm when they sign the LPA.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Relevant professional skills</strong>: If you want to choose someone with relevant

          <summary>Why should you notify people?</summary>
          <p>
          Letting people know about the LPA when it is about to be registered gives you
an extra layer of security. It helps to make sure that you haven't been put under
pressure by anyone to make the LPA. You can give people who know you well the
chance to raise any concerns before the LPA is registered.
          </p>
          <p>
          These people may know something about the way the LPA was made or another
relevant fact that could affect the LPA. This might be especially important if there is a
delay between making your LPA and registering it.</p>
<p>
There are rules about the sort of concerns they can raise. They cannot object to an
LPA simply because they don't like the idea of it.
</p>
          
          </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>Who should be told?</summary>
          <p>
          Many donors choose members of their family or close friends. You can choose up to
five people but they must not include any of your attorneys or replacement attorneys.
          </p>
          <p>
          It is a good idea to talk to people about performing this role before you name them
here, so that they understand what they are expected to do. If they are not happy to
do this for you, then choose someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
          You do not have to choose anybody to be told. However, if you do not choose
anybody, you must choose two people under Question 10 (confirming the donor�s
understanding and free will) instead of one.
          </p>
        </details>
        
        <details>
          <summary>How will the people you name be told?</summary>
          <p>
          Just before you or the attorneys apply to register the LPA, you or they must send
each of the people to be told a form to let them know about the LPA. You can
download copies of the form at the same time as you download the printed LPA
document when you have completed this tool.
          </p>
        </details>
        
        <details>
          <summary>What should those people do?</summary>
          <p>
          If the notified people have no reason for concern then they do not have to say or do
anything. But if they do want to raise concerns about the way the LPA was made or
about some relevant fact that might affect the LPA, they will have five weeks to do
so.
          </p>
          <p>
          The form that you or the attorney sends them when you are about to register the LPA
sets out detailed reasons why they can object. It also tells them how to object.

          There are two types of reason why the notified people can object to an LPA being
registered. These are called "factual grounds" and "prescribed grounds" for objection.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>Factual grounds</strong> - the notified people can ask the Office of the Public Guardian to
stop registration if:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>You or your attorney is bankrupt or interim bankrupt (for property and financial
affairs LPAs only).</li>
  <li>You or your attorney is dead.</li>
  <li>You and your attorney were married or had a civil partnership and that has
been dissolved or annulled.</li>
<li>Your attorney(s) lack the capacity to be an attorney under the LPA.</li>
<li>Your attorney(s) have disclaimed their appointment.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Prescribed grounds</strong> - the notified people can object to the Court of Protection against
registration of the LPA if:
          <ul>
          <li>The power purported to be created by the LPA is not valid as a LPA. e.g. the
person objecting does not believe you had capacity to make an LPA.</li>
          <li>The power created by the instrument no longer exists e.g. you revoked it at a
time when you had capacity to do so.</li>
          <li>There was fraud or undue pressure to cause you to make the power.</li>
          <li>Your attorney proposes to behave in a way that would contravene his authority
or would not be in your best interests.</li>
          </ul>

        <details class="intro" open>
          <summary>How can attorneys work together to make decisions?</summary>
          <p>If you have chosen to have more than one attorney or more than one replacement attorney then you must decide whether you want them to make some or all decisions either together or independently. The legal terms used are "jointly" and "severally". The three choices are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>jointly (making all decisions as a group)</li>
          <li>jointly and severally (making any decision either as a group or individually)</li>
          <li>jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions (it depends on the decision).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          There is information about each of the choices below. However, if you are not sure which option is suitable for your circumstances then you may want to get legal advice.
          </p>
        </details>
    
        <details>
          <summary>How do attorneys work jointly (as a group)?</summary>
          <p>Attorneys appointed jointly must always make all decisions together. They must agree on all decisions and they must all sign any relevant documents.</p>
          <p>You might choose this option if you want to make sure that your attorneys are all in agreement on every decision, regardless of how large or small it is. Unless they all agree on a decision, that decision cannot be made on your behalf.</p>
          <strong>Note</strong>: If you choose this option:
          <ul>
            <li>Some simple decisions that could (or should) be made quickly might be delayed because it takes time to get the attorneys together.</li>
            <li>If your attorneys cannot work together for some reason, your LPA may be cancelled.</li>
            <li>If one of your attorneys dies or can no longer act for some reason, your LPA will be cancelled unless you have appointed a replacement attorney.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
    
        <details>
            <summary>How do attorneys work jointly and severally (as a group or on their own)?</summary>
            <p>
            Your attorneys can make any decisions together but can also make any decisions independently. Any action taken by any attorney alone is as valid as if they were the only attorney. It is up to the attorneys to choose how they make decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
            Many people choose this option because it means that their attorneys have the
flexibility to make simple or urgent decisions quickly and easily. It also means that if
one of the attorneys dies or can no longer act for some reason, the LPA will not be
cancelled.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: If you choose this option you must not say anywhere in the LPA that certain
decisions must be made by one particular attorney. It will be up to the attorneys to
decide who will make any decisions, although you can make suggestions about
certain circumstances under guidance in Question 7 (restrictions and guidance for
attorneys).</p>
          </details>
    
        <details>
            <summary>Examples of working jointly and severally</summary>
          <ul>
          <li>Your attorneys live in different towns so getting together to sign documents or
visit your bank would be difficult to arrange.</li>
          <li>Your attorneys may have different, but complementary skills so that they can
work out between themselves who deals with particular types of decision.</li>
          </ul>
          </details>
    
        <details>
            <summary>How do attorneys work jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions (it depends on the decision)?</summary>
            <p>
            Your attorneys must make certain decisions together but they may also make other
decisions independently. You must decide which decisions all your attorneys must
make together.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you choose this option you must clearly state which decisions the attorneys should
make as a group and which they can make either together or as a group.
            </p>
            <p>
            You might choose this option if you are happy for your attorneys to make day-to-
day decisions independently but want them to get together to make more significant
decisions.

        <details open class="intro">
          <summary>What is life-sustaining treatment?</summary>
          <p>Life-sustaining treatment means any treatment that a doctor considers necessary to keep you alive. Whether or not a treatment is life-sustaining will depend on the specific situation. Some treatments will be life-sustaining in some situations but not in others.</p>
          <strong>Life-sustaining treatment includes:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>a serious surgical operation, like a heart bypass</li>
            <li>chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or other cancer treatment or surgery</li>
            <li>an organ transplant</li>
            <li>artificial nutrition or hydration (food or water given to someone other than by mouth).</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>However, if someone has breathing problems and develops pneumonia, then even a simple course of antibiotics could be regarded as life-sustaining in those circumstances.</p>
          <p>In a health and welfare LPA, your attorneys can only make decisions on your behalf (including decisions about life-sustaining treatment) once you lack mental capacity. This is an important safeguard.</p>  
          </details>
          
          <details>
          <summary>Option A (authorising attorneys to decide)</summary>
          <p>Your attorneys can only make decisions about life-sustaining treatment if you specifically say so, by choosing Option A. This means you authorise your attorneys to decide whether or not to withdraw treatment (eg artificial nutrition or hydration) in situations where you would also have chosen to make that decision.</p>
          <p>In Question 7 you will be able to give your attorneys guidance about your personal preferences so that any decision they make would be as close as possible to the decision you would have made for yourself. For example, your guidance might describe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a medical or physical condition in which you would prefer your attorneys to tell your doctors to withhold life-sustaining treatment</li>
            <li>a medical or physical condition in which you would prefer your attorneys to tell your doctors to keep you alive.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
      
        <details>
          <summary>Option B (NOT authorising attorneys to decide)</summary>
          <p>If you do not want your attorneys to make decisions about life-sustaining treatment, then you should choose Option B. Your doctors will make the decision instead.  If the situation arises your doctors will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>carry out an assessment of your best interests</li>
            <li>take into account, where possible, the views of your attorneys and other people involved in your welfare</li>

        <details open class="intro">
          <summary>What are restrictions and guidance?</summary>
          <p>You can choose certain things that your attorneys must or must not do, or procedures they must follow, when making decisions. These are called <strong>restrictions and conditions</strong> and your attorneys must follow them.</p>
          <p>You can also let your the attorneys know what they would like them to think about when making decisions. This is called <strong>guidance</strong> and your attorneys should take it into account but are not obliged to follow it.</p>
          <p>You do not have to include restrictions or guidance in your LPA. If you have appointed attorneys that you trust completely to make the right decisions then you probably will not need restrictions or guidance.</p>
          <p>There is more information below, including some examples. However you are not sure whether restrictions or guidance would be suitable for your circumstances, orwhat to include and how to complete this question, you may want to get legal advice.</p>
            </details>
        <details>
          <summary>How do restrictions and conditions work?</summary>
          <p>You can choose certain things that your attorneys must or must not do, or procedures they must follow, when making decisions. Your attorneys <strong>must</strong> follow the restrictions and conditions when they make decisions under the LPA.</p>
          <p>You do not have to choose any restrictions or conditions. You should have appointed attorneys who you fully trust and so you may be happy for them to make all decisions as they see fit. If you leave this part of Question 7 blank, then the attorneys will be free to make all decisions as they see fit and to choose how they will act under the LPA.</p>
          <p>For a property and finance LPA, this is a good opportunity to include an additional safeguard relating to your attorneys' decisions. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A condition that they give annual accounts to a third party (such as an accountant, a member of the donor's family or a friend).</li>
            <li>A condition that they follow professional advice on certain decisions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> If an LPA contains a restriction that is not workable in practice, it may not be registered. A common error is to have appointed attorneys to make decisions in a certain way in Question 6, then include a restriction that requires them to act differently.</p>
          <p>For example, if you appoint your attorneys jointly and severally (to work either as a group or independently) you cannot:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>include a restriction that they must act jointly (as a group) on a specific decision.</li>
          <li>use restrictions and conditions to make your attorneys do anything against the law.</li>

          <summary>How does guidance work?</summary>
          <p>You can tell your attorneys what you would like them to think about when making decisions. This is called <strong>guidance</strong>. It is an opportunity to set out your preferences or beliefs so that your attorneys will take them into account. Your attorneys are not obliged to follow the guidance but it should help them understand your wishes.</p>
          <h3>Guidance might include:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>In a property and finance LPA, your views on types of investment, managing bank accounts and dealing with taxes.</li>
            <li>In a health and welfare LPA, your views on medical treatment, personal care and where you prefer to live.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You do not have to give any guidance. If you trust your attorneys to understand your beliefs and values then you may feel there is no need for further guidance in the LPA.</p>
          <p>If you would like your attorneys to do a particular thing, but it is something that you are not allowed to include as a restriction or condition, you can sometimes include it in guidance. Your attorneys will not be obliged to follow the guidance, but they will know that it is one of your wishes that they do so.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> If there is anything you definitely want your attorneys to do, then it should be included in the restrictions and conditions.</p>

              <p>Your attorneys can only use your LPA to make decisions on your behalf after it has been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).</p>
          <p>You do not have to register an LPA as soon as it has been completed, but it is a good idea to do so in case it contains any errors that you need to correct.

          <p>If your attorneys apply to register the form after you have lost mental capacity, then it will not be possible for you to correct any errors and the LPA will not be registered and cannot be used. Your attorneys (or someone else) will have to apply to the Court of Protection to get the power to make decisions on your behalf. This can be a long and expensive process.</p>

              <summary>How do you apply to register your LPA?</summary>
              <p>Use this online tool to enter some details that the OPG needs to process your application. You can then print the relevant form and make payment online. You must sign the application form and send it and the signed LPA document to the OPG.</p>
        </details>
    
        <details>
              <summary>Complete application details online</summary>

              <p>Send the following documents to the OPG:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>the signed LPA document (including pages 1 and 2, which are important parts of the form) and any continuation sheets that have been printed and signed</li>
                <li>the signed "Application to register a Lasting Power of Attorney" form (emailed to you following payment)</li>
                <li>the signed "Application for exemption or remission of EPA/LPA application to register fees" form (LPA120A) (only if you are applying for exemption or remission of fees)</li>

        <details>
          <summary>What happens next?</summary>
              <p>The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) will process the LPA and hold it for a waiting period of at least six weeks so that the people to be told have an opportunity to object to its registration if there is good reason to do so.</p>
              <p>If the OPG finds any errors or problems with the LPA itself, they will contact you to try to resolve the matter. If there are no objections and no problems with the LPA, the OPG will register it and send the original back to you with the relevant official markings to show that it is valid and ready to use when necessary.</p>

        <h2 tabindex="-1">When was the LPA signed?</h2>
        <details open class="intro">
              <summary>Why do you need to give these dates?</summary>
              <p>It is essential that the LPA was signed in the correct order or it will not be registered. You need to confirm the order of signing by entering the dates.</p>
          <p>The correct order of signing is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the donor,</li>
            <li>then the certificate provider(s), and</li>
            <li>finally the attorneys and any replacement attorneys (if you have appointed more than one attorney or replacement attorney, their signatures can be in any order as long as they are later than the certificate provider).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you notice that the dates on which the relevant people signed the LPA document are not in the correct chronological order, then you will have to print out the document again and have the relevant people sign in the correct order before you attempt to register the LPA.</p>

        <details open class="intro">
              <summary>Why do I need to give the correspondent address?</summary>
              <p>The Office of the Public Guardian needs to know who to contact if they have any queries about the application. They will send the registered copy of the LPA to that person. You can select from the list below.</p>
        </details>

      <section class="hidden" id="help-previouslpa">
        <h2 tabindex="-1">Have you made any other powers of attorney?</h2>
        <details open class="intro">
              <summary>Why do I need to answer this?</summary>
              <p>The Office of the Public Guardian needs to know if you (the donor) have previously made any other Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) or LPA so they can check the details of that earlier power of attorney.
              </p>
              <p>
              One important check they make is that your certificate provider has not been appointed as your attorney in any other EPA or LPA that you may have made. This is because a certificate provider on one LPA must not also be an attorney for the same donor, even if it is under a different LPA.

        <h2 tabindex="-1">Does the donor want to apply for an exemption or remission of application fees?</h2>
        <details open class="intro">
          <summary>What is exemption or remission of fees?</summary>
          <p>If you (the donor) receive certain means-tested benefits you may be exempt from paying fees (you will pay nothing), or if you have an annual income of less than £12,000 you will be entitled to a 50% discount (called a "remission").</p>
          <p>It is only the donor's financial circumstances that are relevant. If the application is being made by an attorney, their financial circumstances are not taken into account. (The attorney can pay the fee and reclaim it from your (the donor) funds.)</p>
          <p>You will go through a set of questions to determine whether you are eligible and, if so, you will have to send written proof to the Office of the Public Guardian along with a form that you should download and sign at the end of the registration process.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
              <summary>How do you qualify for exemption from paying fees?</summary>
          <p>If you (the donor) receive any of the following means-tested benefits you are eligible for a full exemption from paying fees:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Income Support</li>
            <li>Employment and Support Allowance (income related)</li>
            <li>Income-based Job-Seeker's Allowance</li>
            <li>Pension Guarantee Credit element of State Pension Credit</li>
            <li>a combination of Working Tax Credit <strong>and</strong> either:
            
              <ul>
                <li>Child Tax Credit, or</li>
                <li>Disability Element Working Tax Credit, or</li>
                <li>Severe Disability Element (within the Working Tax Credit) - this does not include Disability Living Allowance or Invalidity Benefit</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Housing Benefit</li>
            <li>Council Tax Benefit (not the 25% single person reduction or exemption)</li>
            <li>Local Housing Allowance.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note</strong>: Even if you do receive one of those benefits, if you have <strong>also</strong> been awarded damages of more than £16,000, which were disregarded when determining eligibility for the benefit, you will not qualify for an exemption from paying fees.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What proof do you need to send in for exemption from paying fees?</summary>
          <p>You will need to prove that you receive one of the relevant benefits. Your proof should be a copy of a recent letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or another relevant benefit provider confirming your receipt of benefits.</p>
          <p>The letter must be dated within the last three months. If you have not received a letter from DWP or relevant benefit provider in the last three months you may have to contact them to request a letter confirming your benefit.</p>
          <p>You will have to send the proof to the OPG along with the application to register and the application for remission forms.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How do you qualify for remission of fees?</summary>
          <p>If you (the donor) have a gross annual income of less than £12,000 you will be eligible for a 50% reduction of the fee.</p>
          <p>Gross annual income may come from a range of sources, including employment, non-means-tested benefits (such as Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance), pensions and interest from capital investments.</p>
        </details>

            <details>
              <summary>What proof do you need to send in for remission of fees?</summary>
              <p>You will need to prove your (the donor) income. Examples of proof include wage slips, bank statements or statements from a pension provider, covering a period of three months or more.</p>
          <p>You will have to send the proof to the OPG along with the application to register and the application for remission forms.</p>
