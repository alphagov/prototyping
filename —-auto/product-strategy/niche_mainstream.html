<img src="images/onion-model.jpg" />
<p>The onion model describes a layered approach to content, in which 80% of users find what they need from very simple, very readable overviews, undiluted by all the possible variations, whilst detail, variations and more technical topics are handled by Niche mainstream content.
<p>This content can be less readable (i.e. anchor links with lists of variations) because people will only read the sections relevant to them.</p>
<p>Specifically technical content can be handled by Specialist formats and finally by Legislation.</p></div>
