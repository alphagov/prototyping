				 <h3>Insights</h3>
				<div class="insights"><h4>Current product suits collecting resources</h4>
<p>The current mainstream browse page provides more contextual information and is best suited to knowledge-hungry users who are uncertain what they're looking for and want to  <b>collect</b> any relevant content.</p>
<p>It's also better for less confident users who find 'page->click->page' interactions easier to understand.</p>

<h4>Prototype suits quickly task finding</h4>
<p>The prototype suits task-focused users who have a good idea what they're looking for and need to <b>find</b> a single item as quickly as possible.</p>

<h4>Prototype exposes Information Architecture issues</h4>
<p>The prototype works best for users who already have knowledge of the domain as they must find their item with the minimum of contextual information, and potentially in a long alphabetical list.</p></div>
