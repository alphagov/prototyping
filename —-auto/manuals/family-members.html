      <p>Rules for family members applying after 9 July 2012. Paragraphs A277 to A280E.</p>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <h4>A277</h4>
        <p>From 9 July 2012 Appendix FM will apply to all applications to which Part 8 of these rules applied on or before 8 July 2012 except where the provisions of Part 8 are preserved and continue to apply, as set out in paragraph A280. </p>
        <h4>A277A. </h4>
        <p>Where the Secretary of State is considering an application for indefinite leave to remain to which Part 8 of these rules continues to apply (excluding an application from a family member of a Relevant Points Based System Migrant), and where the applicant: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) does not meet the requirements of Part 8 for indefinite leave to remain, and</li>
          <li>(b) continues to meet the requirements for limited leave to remain on which the applicant's last grant of limited leave to remain under Part 8 was based, further limited leave to remain under Part 8 may be granted of such a period and subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State deems appropriate. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph an applicant last granted limited leave to enter under Part 8 will be considered as if they had last been granted limited leave to remain under Part 8; or </li>
          <li>(c) if the applicant does not meet the requirements of Part 8 for indefinite leave to remain as a bereaved partner only because paragraph 322(1C)(iii) or 322(1C)(iv) of these rules applies, the applicant will be granted limited leave to remain under Part 8 for a period not exceeding 30 months and subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State deems appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>A277B.</h4>
        <p>Where the Secretary of State is considering an application for indefinite leave to remain to which Part 8 of these rules continues to apply (excluding an application from a family member of a Relevant Points Based System Migrant) and where the application does not meet the requirements of Part 8 for indefinite leave to remain or limited leave to remain:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) the application will also be considered under paragraphs R-LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRPT.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) and EX.1. of Appendix FM (family life) and paragraphs 276ADE to 276DH (private life) of these rules;</li>
          <li>(b) if the applicant meets the requirements for leave under those paragraphs of Appendix FM or paragraphs 276ADE to 276DH (except the requirement for a valid application under that route), the applicant will be granted leave under those provisions; and</li>
          <li>(c) if the applicant is granted leave under those provisions, the period of the applicant's continuous leave under Part 8 at the date of application will be counted towards the period of continuous leave which must be completed before the applicant can apply for indefinite leave to remain under those provisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>A277C.</h4>
        <p>Subject to paragraphs A277 to A280, paragraph 276A0 and paragraph GEN.1.9. of Appendix FM of these rules, where the Secretary of State deems it appropriate, the Secretary of State will consider any application to which the provisions of Appendix FM (family life) and paragraphs 276ADE to 276DH (private life) of these rules do not already apply, under paragraphs R-LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRPT.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) and EX.1. of Appendix FM (family life) and paragraph 276ADE (private life) of these rules. If the applicant meets the requirements for leave under those provisions (except the requirement for a valid application), the applicant will be granted leave under paragraph D-LTRP.1.2. or D-LTRPT.1.2. of Appendix FM or under paragraph 276BE of these rules.</p>
        <h4>A278</h4>
        <p>The requirements to be met under Part 8 after 9 July 2012 may be modified or supplemented by the requirements in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.</p>
        <h4>A279 </h4>
        <p>Paragraphs 398-399A shall apply to all immigration decisions made further to applications under Part 8 and paragraphs 276A-276D where a decision is made on or after 9 July 2012, irrespective of the date the application was made.</p>
        <h4>A280</h4>
        <p>The following provisions of Part 8 apply in the manner and circumstances specified:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) The following paragraphs apply in respect of all applications made under Part 8 and Appendix FM, irrespective of the date of application or decision:</li>

      <p>Rules for spouses or partners of British citizens appying to enter or stay in the UK. Paragraphs 277 to 289.</p>
      <div class="hidden-content">
        <h4>277.</h4>
        <p>Nothing in these Rules shall be construed as permitting a person to be granted entry clearance, leave to enter, leave to remain or variation of leave as a spouse or civil partner of another if either the applicant or the sponsor will be aged under 18 on the date of arrival in the United Kingdom or (as the case may be) on the date on which the leave to remain or variation of leave would be granted. In these rules the term "sponsor" includes "partner" as defined in GEN 1.2 of Appendix FM. </p>
        <h4>278.</h4>
        <p>Nothing in these Rules shall be construed as allowing a person to be granted entry clearance, leave to enter, leave to remain or variation of leave as the spouse and civil partner of a man or woman (the sponsor) if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(i) his or her marriage or civil partnership to the sponsor is polygamous; and</li>
          <li>(ii) there is another person living who is the husband or wife of the sponsor and who:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>(a) is, or at any time since his or her marriage or civil partnership to the sponsor has been, in the United Kingdom; or</li>
          <li>(b) has been granted a certificate of entitlement in respect of the right of abode mentioned in Section 2(1)(a) of the Immigration Act 1988 or an entry clearance to enter the United Kingdom as the husband or wife of the sponsor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the purpose of this paragraph a marriage or civil partnership may be polygamous although at its inception neither party had any other spouse or civil partner.</p>
        <h4>279.</h4>
        <p>Paragraph 278 does not apply to any person who seeks entry clearance, leave to enter, leave to remain or variation of leave where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>(i) he or she has been in the United Kingdom before 1 August 1988 having been admitted for the purpose of settlement as the husband or wife of the sponsor; or</li>
          <li>(ii) he or she has, since their marriage or civil partnership to the sponsor, been in the United Kingdom at any time when there was no such other spouse or civil partner living as is mentioned in paragraph 278 (ii).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>But where a person claims that paragraph 278 does not apply to them because they have been in the United Kingdom in circumstances which cause them to fall within sub paragraphs (i) or (ii) of that paragraph it shall be for them to prove that fact. </li>
          <li>280. For the purposes of paragraphs 278 and 279 the presence of any wife or husband in the United Kingdom in any of the following circumstances shall be disregarded:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>(i) as a visitor; or </li>
          <li>(ii) an illegal entrant; or</li>
          <li>(iii) in circumstances whereby a person is deemed by Section 11(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 not to have entered the United Kingdom.</li>

        <h4>281.</h4>
        <p>The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter the United Kingdom with a view to settlement as the spouse or civil partner of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom or who is on the same occasion being admitted for settlement are that: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>(i) (a)(i) the applicant is married to or the civil partner of a person present and settled in the United Kingdom or who is on the same occasion being admitted for settlement; and </li>
          <li>__ __(ii) the applicant provides an original English language test certificate in speaking and listening from an English language test provider approved by the Secretary of State for these purposes, which clearly shows the applicant's name and the qualification obtained (which must meet or exceed level A1 of the Common European Framework of Reference) unless: </li>
          <li> (a) the applicant is aged 65 or over at the time he makes his application; or </li>
          <li>(b) the applicant has a physical or mental condition that would prevent him from meeting the requirement; or; </li>
          <li>(c) there are exceptional compassionate circumstances that would prevent the applicant from meeting the requirement; or </li>
