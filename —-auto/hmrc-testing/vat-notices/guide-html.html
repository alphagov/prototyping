<h3 id="visits-by-vat-officers">
<span class="number">3.2 </span>2.2 Visits by VAT officers</h3>

<p>From time to time you will be visited at your principal place of business by an officer from your VAT office. The officer will examine your business records, methods and premises and give you guidance. The reason for this is to make sure that the correct tax is accounted for at the right time. We want you to pay no more and no less than is due.</p>

<h4 id="when-will-you-visit-me">2.2.1 When will you visit me?</h4>

<p>This will depend on the size and complexity of your business and your past compliance with legislation. Businesses which send in late or incorrect declarations and payments are visited more often. It is therefore in your interest to make sure that your declarations are correct from the outset.</p>

<p>Before we visit we will agree a mutually convenient appointment date and time. On occasion we will call without an appointment. One reason for this may be to see the day to day operation of the business.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-will-a-visit-last">2.2.2 How long will a visit last?</h4>

<p>Officers aim to carry out their duties with as little inconvenience to you as possible. For a small business, a visit may only take a few hours - for a large or complex business it can last 2 or more days.</p>

<h4 id="what-happens-during-a-visit">2.2.3 What happens during a visit?</h4>

<p>During the visit our officer will:</p>

<ul>
<li>discuss with you the various aspects of your business</li>
  <li>give an indication of the length of the visit</li>
  <li>examine the records of the business, and</li>
  <li>advise you of overpayments as well as underpayments.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the visit the officer will:</p>

<ul>
<li>review the work performed</li>
  <li>discuss any concerns arising, and</li>
  <li>agree what is to be done in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where an error is found, the officer will:</p>

<ul>
<li>describe how the adjustment will be made</li>
  <li>agree the adjustment whenever possible, and</li>
  <li>tell you that you have the right to a review of their decision by an officer not previously involved in the matter or to appeal to an independent tribunal. If you opt for a review you can still appeal to the tribunal after the review has finished if you are unhappy with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of things that you can do to help the visit go smoothly. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>advising us early of the reasons for any significant changes in the tax or duties declared by you. You should do this by writing to the VAT Written Enquiries Team</li>
  <li>keeping your records and payments up to date</li>
  <li>providing us with the information and explanations we request;</li>
  <li>asking us if you are unsure of any matter connected with the tax. We will not normally have time to look at all aspects of your records and business, so you cannot assume that you are accounting for the tax or duty correctly on everything just because no errors are found. It is therefore in your interests to ask if you are unsure</li>
  <li>helping us to understand your business and records</li>
  <li>replying to enquiries within the specified time, and</li>
  <li>quoting your VAT number when you contact us.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will find out more about visits from HMRC in Notice 989 Visits by HM Revenue &amp; Customs officers, available from our VAT Helpline.</p>

<h3 id="tax-avoidance">
<span class="number">3.3 </span>2.3 Tax avoidance</h3>

<p>Tax avoidance is the use of contrived arrangements or structures to achieve a tax advantage – an increase in tax recovery, a reduction in the tax due or a tax deferral – contrary to the purpose and spirit of the legislation. Tax avoidance puts at risk Government revenues. It can also give a business an unfair advantage over others and threaten tax simplification measures. We have to take action to counter this and will continue to do so. That action includes the use of litigation, or the introduction of new legislation.</p>

<h3 id="vat-law">
<span class="number">3.4 </span>2.4 VAT law</h3>

<p>VAT law in the European Union is governed by various Directives, notably the Principal VAT Directive (2006).</p>

<p>The Directives are given effect in the UK mainly by the Value Added Tax Act 1994 as amended by subsequent Finance Acts. But there are many detailed rules in Statutory Instruments. These are either orders made by the Treasury or regulations made by HMRC. Copies of the Act and of Statutory Instruments are available from Stationery Office bookshops.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, this notice and the other VAT notices explain how HMRC interpret the VAT law. However, sometimes the law says that the detailed rules on a particular matter will be set out in a notice or leaflet published by HMRC rather than in a Statutory Instrument. When this is done, that part of the notice or leaflet has legal force, and that fact will be clearly shown at the relevant point in the publication.</p>

<h3 id="when-you-can-rely-on-advice-from-hmrc">
<span class="number">3.5 </span>2.5 When you can rely on advice from HMRC</h3>

<p>HMRC aims to provide information and advice that will give certainty to customers concerning the tax consequences of their transactions, their obligations, liabilities and entitlements. The general principle, therefore, is that you should be able to rely on any information or advice HMRC provides, because it is correct.</p>

<p>There may be a small number of cases where HMRC provides information or advice that is incorrect in law. Where this happens, HMRC will be bound by such advice provided that it is clear, unequivocal and explicit, and that you can demonstrate that:</p>

<ul>
<li>you reasonably relied on the advice</li>
  <li>where appropriate, you made a full disclosure of all the relevant facts</li>
  <li>the application of the law would result in your financial detriment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where HMRC has given incorrect information or advice, our primary duty is to collect the correct amount of tax as required by the law, and therefore there will be some circumstances where HMRC will not be bound by the advice given.</p>

<p>Where HMRC provides you with erroneous advice that is binding on us, and subsequently notify you that it is incorrect, you will only be required to start accounting for tax on the correct basis from the date of that notification.</p>

<h3 id="extra-statutory-concessions">
<span class="number">3.6 </span>2.6 Extra-statutory concessions</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances where remission or repayment of VAT is not provided for by law, we may allow relief on an extra-statutory basis. The use of a concession may be restricted, for example, if it is used for the purpose of tax avoidance (see paragraph 2.3).</p>

<p>You will find more about this and a list of these concessions in Notice 48 Extra-statutory concessions.</p>

<h3 id="interest-in-cases-of-departmental-error">
<span class="number">3.7 </span>2.7 Interest in cases of Departmental error</h3>

<p>You can claim interest where, as a result of an error on our part you:</p>

<ul>
<li>have paid too much VAT</li>
  <li>have underclaimed VAT, or</li>
  <li>were prevented from recovering VAT at the proper time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can claim for the period of time during which you have not been able to use your money.</p>

<p>You should make your claim in writing to the VAT Written Enquiries Team, who will consider each case on its merits.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-my-rights-as-a-taxpayer">
<span class="number">3.8 </span>2.8 What are my rights as a taxpayer?</h3>

<p>As a taxpayer, you have important rights and entitlements.</p>

<p>It includes standards of service which specifically relate to our administration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>VAT</li>
  <li>excise and inland customs, and</li>
  <li>the import and export of freight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your cooperation in all aspects of the tax collection process is appreciated.</p>

<p>Under the Open Government Code of Practice on Access to Government Information you are entitled to see certain information held by HMRC. See Notice 951 Freedom of Information Act 2000 for further details.</p>

<h3 id="complaints">
<span class="number">3.9 </span>2.9 Complaints</h3>

<p>Although our aim is always to provide a high standard of service, sometimes things may go wrong. If they do, we have internal procedures for handling complaints fairly and speedily.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, you should try to resolve your complaint on the spot with our officer, but if you are unable to do so you should contact one of our Regional Complaints Units.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the decision, you can ask the Adjudicator to look into your case. The Adjudicator’s service is free.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-vat-about">
<span class="number">4.2 </span>3.2 What is VAT about?</h3>

<p>VAT is a tax on consumer expenditure. It is collected on business transactions, imports and acquisitions.</p>

<p>Most business transactions involve supplies of goods or services. VAT is payable if they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>supplies made in the United Kingdom (UK) or the Isle of Man</li>
  <li>by a taxable person</li>
  <li>in the course or furtherance of business, and</li>
  <li>are not specifically exempted or zero-rated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplies which are made in the UK or the Isle of Man and which are not exempt are called <strong>taxable supplies</strong>.</p>

<p>A <strong>taxable person</strong> is an individual, firm, company and so on who is, or is required to be, registered for VAT. A person who makes taxable supplies above certain value limits is required to be registered.</p>

<p>A person who makes taxable supplies below these limits is entitled to be registered in the UK on a voluntary basis if they wish, in order, for example, to recover VAT incurred in relation to these taxable supplies.</p>

<p>In addition, a person who is not registered for VAT in the UK but acquires goods from another EU member state, or makes distance sales in the UK, above certain value limits may be required to register for VAT in the UK (and such persons may register voluntarily if their acquisitions or distance sales are below these limits).</p>

<p>There is more about these matters in Section 6.</p>

<p>Supplies are outside the scope of the tax if they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>made by someone who is not a taxable person</li>
  <li>made outside the UK and the Isle of Man (but see paragraph 4.8.3 for special place of supply rules for certain international services), or</li>
  <li>not made in the course or furtherance of business.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-many-rates-of-vat-are-there">
<span class="number">4.3 </span>3.3 How many rates of VAT are there?</h3>

<p>There are three rates of VAT:</p>

<ul>
<li>a standard rate, currently 20%</li>
  <li>a reduced rate, currently 5%, and</li>
  <li>a zero rate.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="historic-vat-rates-in-the-uk">3.3.1 Historic VAT rates in the UK</h4>

<p>VAT was introduced into the UK on 1 April 1973. The zero rate has existed throughout that time. There have been changes to the standard and reduced rates, plus a briefly introduced higher rate, and these are listed below:</p>

<p>Some supplies of goods and services are charged at the <strong>reduced rate</strong>, which is currently 5%. These are supplies which it is felt should not attract the full rate of VAT.</p>

<p>Reduced-rated supplies are taxable, and include the right of the person making the supply to recover the VAT on their own business expenditure (subject to certain restrictions - see paragraph 4.6).</p>

<p>For a full list of reduced-rated supplies, see Section 29.</p>

<h3 id="is-vat-payable-on-zero-rated-supplies">
<span class="number">4.5 </span>3.5 Is VAT payable on zero-rated supplies?</h3>

<p>VAT is not payable on <strong>zero-rated</strong> supplies, and an invoice for a zero-rated supply will not constitute a VAT invoice (paragraph 15.10 explains why this is important for tax point purposes).</p>

<p>However, zero-rated supplies are treated as taxable supplies in all other respects, including the right of the person making the supply to recover the VAT on their own business expenditure (subject to certain restrictions - see paragraph 4.6).</p>

<p>For a full list of zero-rated supplies, see Section 29.</p>

<h3 id="is-vat-payable-on-exempt-supplies">
<span class="number">4.6 </span>3.6 Is VAT payable on exempt supplies?</h3>

<p>Some supplies are <strong>exempt</strong> from VAT, which means that no tax is payable - but, equally, the person making the supply cannot normally recover any of the VAT on their own expenses.</p>

<p><strong>However, it is possible to choose to standard-rate some supplies of property which would otherwise be exempt, by opting to tax, whereby the supplies you make of an interest in land and/or buildings will, in most cases, become taxable (see Notice 742A Opting to tax land and buildings).</strong></p>

<p>For a full list of exempt supplies, see Section 29.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-find-further-information-on-liability-and-rates-of-tax">
<span class="number">4.7 </span>3.7 Where can I find further information on liability and rates of tax?</h3>

<p>Section 29 tells you about the areas of business where some supplies may be exempt, reduced rated or zero-rated. It also lists the notices which tell you more about this.</p>

<p>If you have read Section 29 and you think that any of your supplies might be zero-rated, reduced rated or exempt, you should read the appropriate notice.</p>

<p>If the rate of tax or the liability of something you supply changes, you should read Section 30.</p>

<span class="number">5. </span>4.General explanation of VAT: the basic mechanism for VAT</h2>

<h3 id="how-does-vat-work">
<span class="number">5.1 </span>4.1 How does VAT work?</h3>

<p>If you make taxable supplies (standard-rated, reduced-rated or zero-rated), you have to account to HMRC for the VAT due. This is your <strong>output tax</strong>.</p>

<p>You will normally charge the VAT to your customers. If your customers are registered for VAT and the supplies are for use in their business, the VAT is their <strong>input tax</strong>. In the same way, VAT charged to you on your business purchases is <strong>your</strong> input tax.</p>

<p>As a registered person, you can reclaim from HMRC as much of the VAT on your purchases and imports, as relates to the standard-rated, reduced-rated and zero-rated supplies you make. In principle, you cannot reclaim VAT which relates to any non-business activity or to any exempt supplies you make.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-account-for-vat-on-my-supplies">
<span class="number">5.2 </span>4.2 How do I account for VAT on my supplies?</h3>

<p>At predetermined intervals you pay to HMRC the excess of your output tax over the VAT you can reclaim as input tax. However, if the input tax you can reclaim is <strong>more</strong> than your output tax, you can reclaim the difference from us.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-claim-vat-relief-if-my-customer-has-not-paid-me">
<span class="number">5.3 </span>4.3 Can I claim VAT relief if my customer has not paid me?</h3>

<p>If you make taxable supplies of goods or services to a customer for which you are not paid, you may be able to reclaim relief from VAT on the bad debts. You can find out more about this in Notice 700/18 Relief from VAT on bad debts.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-i-be-making-a-supply-of-goods">
<span class="number">5.4 </span>4.4 When will I be making a supply of goods?</h3>

<p>You supply goods if you pass the exclusive ownership of moveable items to another person.</p>

<p>You also supply goods if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>transfer them under an agreement such as a hire-purchase agreement - but not if you <strong>transfer such an agreement</strong>
</li>
  <li>provide water or any form of power, heat, refrigeration or ventilation; but <strong>not</strong> if you hire out equipment which does this - that is a supply of services (see Notice 701/19 Fuel and power and Notice 701/16 Water and sewerage services)</li>
  <li>supply a major interest in land; broadly speaking, the freehold, or in Scotland the dominium utile, or a lease exceeding 21 years (see Notice 742 Land and property and Notice 708 Buildings and construction), or</li>
  <li>transfer goods permanently out of the business for your private use.</li>
</ul>
<p>You do <strong>not</strong> make a supply if you provide goods (such as overalls or tools) to employees solely for the purpose of their employment and make no charge.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-i-be-making-a-supply-of-services">
<span class="number">5.5 </span>4.5 When will I be making a supply of services?</h3>

<p>You supply services if you do something, other than supplying goods, for a <strong>consideration</strong>. A consideration is any form of payment in money or in kind, including anything which is itself a supply (see paragraph 7.2).</p>

<p>You also supply services if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>lend goods to someone for use outside your business</li>
  <li>hire goods to someone</li>
  <li>produce goods from someone else’s materials</li>
  <li>use goods owned by the business outside the business</li>
  <li>agree, for a consideration, to refrain from doing something, or</li>
  <li>agree to grant, assign or surrender a right for a consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you supply services, you should read Notice 741A Place of supply of services.</p>

<h3 id="business-and-non-business">
<span class="number">5.6 </span>4.6 Business and non-business</h3>

<h4 id="introduction">4.6.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>It is very important to understand the difference between business and non-business activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>you must account for VAT on <strong>all</strong> the taxable supplies you make by way of business, and you can treat as input tax VAT charged on goods and services which you get for your business (see Section 10) <strong>but</strong>
</li>
  <li>if you also carry out non-business activities, it could affect the amount of VAT you can treat as input tax. VAT charged on goods and services which you do not get for your business is not input tax and you cannot reclaim it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-does-business-mean">4.6.2 What does ‘‘business’’ mean?</h4>

<p>In VAT terms, business means any continuing activity which is mainly concerned with making supplies to other persons for a consideration (see paragraph 4.5). The activity must have a degree of frequency and scale and be continued over a period of time. Isolated transactions are not normally business for VAT purposes.</p>

<p>It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the way in which self-employed people carrying on any trade, vocation or profession, as well as companies, earn an income</li>
  <li>the provision of membership benefits by clubs, associations and similar bodies in return for a subscription or other consideration, and</li>
  <li>admission to premises for a charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may also include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the activities of clubs and other recreational bodies, and</li>
  <li>some of the activities of charities and non-profit making bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, even if your activities have some or all the characteristics of a business, they are <strong>not</strong> business if they are essentially a recreation or hobby and the making of taxable supplies is only incidental to this.</p>

<h4 id="non-business">4.6.3 Non-business</h4>

<p>If you have any non-business activities, you will not be able to reclaim all the VAT you are charged on your purchases. This is because the VAT charged on goods and services used for non-business purposes is not input tax and cannot be reclaimed.</p>

<h4 id="examples-of-non-business-activities">4.6.4 Examples of non-business activities</h4>

<p>Purely private or personal activities are, of course, non-business. Many charities, philanthropic and voluntary bodies and other non-profit making organisations have non-business activities. For example, these may all be non-business activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>providing free services or information</li>
  <li>maintaining museums, parks or historic sites (unless there is an admission or other charge), and</li>
  <li>publicising religious or political views.</li>
</ul>
<p>An activity which is carried out mainly as a hobby, such as stamp collecting, is not a business. However, if you start to sell items you collect, or have made, on a regular and continuing basis, then, under the rules outlined above, your hobby could become a business for VAT purposes.</p>

<p>If you want to know whether this affects you, you can phone our VAT Helpline or write to the VAT Written Enquiries Team.</p>

<h4 id="some-particular-situations">4.6.5 Some particular situations</h4>

<p>(a) <strong>Grants or donations</strong></p>

<p>Non-business activities are often financed largely from grants or donations. As long as those making the grants or donations receive no direct benefit in return, this income is not the consideration for any supply and is outside the scope of VAT.</p>

<p>(b) <strong>Activities are mainly non-business</strong></p>

<p>A body whose main activities are non-business may still have some activities which count as business for VAT purposes, such as selling goods to raise funds, running a staff canteen or charging admission fees. If the taxable turnover from these activities is over the registration limits, the body should be registered for VAT.</p>

<p>(c) <strong>Charities</strong></p>

<p>Notice 701/1 Charities gives more information on non-business activities for such bodies.</p>

<p>(d) <strong>Local authorities and similar bodies</strong></p>

<p>Special rules apply if you are a body covered by the Value Added Tax Act 1994, Section 33 (see Notice 749 Local authorities and similar bodies).</p>

<h4 id="united-kingdom">4.7.1 United Kingdom</h4>

<p>The United Kingdom is made up of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the territorial waters. It does <strong>not</strong> include the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>However, for VAT purposes the Isle of Man is treated as part of the UK. If you have customers or suppliers in the Isle of Man, the VAT rules are the same as if they were in the UK. Goods sent from the UK to the Isle of Man or vice versa do not count as imports or exports for VAT purposes.</p>

<h4 id="isle-of-man">4.7.2 Isle of Man</h4>

<p>VAT is chargeable in the Isle of Man under Manx law which generally parallels UK legislation. References in this notice to the UK also apply to the Isle of Man unless the text indicates otherwise.</p>

<h4 id="channel-islands">4.7.3 Channel Islands</h4>

<p>There is no VAT in the Channel Islands. Goods passing between the Channel Islands and the UK or the Isle of Man are imported or exported for VAT purposes. See Section 5.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Where supplies take place in the UK, the supplier may be liable to register here and account for VAT on their supplies. No UK VAT would be chargeable on supplies that take place outside the UK.</p>

<p><strong>If you are unsure about the place of supply of goods, you can get further advice by calling our VAT Helpline, or writing to the VAT Written Enquiries Team.</strong></p>

<h4 id="services">4.8.3 Services</h4>

<p>From 1 January 2010 there are two general rules for determining the place of supply of services: one for business to business (B2B) and one for business to consumer (B2C).</p>

<p>The B2B general rule for supplies of services is that the supply is made where the customer belongs.</p>

<p>The B2C general rule for supplies of services is that the supply is made where the supplier belongs.</p>

<p>You <strong>belong</strong> where you have a business or some other fixed establishment, including a branch or agency. If you have no such establishment, you belong where you usually live. In the case of a company this is where it is legally constituted. If you have establishments in more than one country, the supply takes place at the location of the establishment most directly concerned with the supply.</p>

<p>However, there are also special place of supply rules for certain services, and these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>services relating to land and property</li>
  <li>services of the hiring of a means of transport</li>
  <li>services involving physical performance</li>
  <li>restaurant and catering services</li>
  <li>passenger transport</li>
  <li>B2C freight transport services</li>
  <li>certain intermediary services</li>
  <li>certain B2C supplies of services where the customer belongs outside the EU.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you buy from a third party travel, hotel, holiday and certain other supplies of a kind enjoyed by travellers, and resell them as principal, or as an agent acting in its own name, there are different place of supply rules. See Notice 709/5 Tour operators’ margin scheme.</p>

<h3 id="imported-goods">
<span class="number">6.2 </span>5.2 Imported goods</h3>

<p>When goods are imported into the UK from outside the EU, VAT is normally due at the same rate as on a supply of those goods in the UK.</p>

<p>VAT must be paid when you import the goods or, if you or your agent is approved for duty deferment, you can defer payment with any duty.</p>

<p>If you import goods into the UK from outside the EU, you should read Notice 702 Imports and Notice 101 Deferring duty, VAT and other charges.</p>

<h4 id="taxable-supplies">6.1.1 Taxable supplies</h4>

<p>Supplies of any goods and services, which are subject to VAT at any rate, including the zero-rate, are called taxable supplies. They are called taxable supplies whether you are registered for VAT or not.</p>

<h4 id="when-must-i-register-and-start-to-charge-vat">6.1.2 When must I register and start to charge VAT?</h4>

<p>If the value of your taxable supplies is over a specified limit, you must register for VAT, unless your taxable supplies are wholly or mainly zero-rated in which case you may apply for exemption from registration. The limits are shown in the supplement to Notice 700/1 Should I be registered for VAT?</p>

<p>If you are a non-established taxable person (NETP), you <strong>must</strong> register for VAT in the UK and start to charge VAT if you make <strong>any</strong> taxable supplies here. For further information on NETPs see paragraph 6.2.3.</p>

<p>If you are registered for VAT, you must charge and account for VAT on all your taxable supplies from the date that you are first registered.</p>

<p>For further information see Notice 700/1 Should I be registered for VAT? Notice 700/1 also explains how to apply for:</p>

<ul>
<li>exemption from registration if your taxable supplies are wholly or mainly zero-rated</li>
  <li>voluntary registration if the value of your taxable supplies is below the limits for compulsory registration.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a local authority, special rules apply regarding VAT registration - see Notice 749 Local authorities and similar bodies.</p>

<h4 id="when-do-i-notify-you">6.1.3 When do I notify you?</h4>

<p>You must notify the VAT Registration Service within 30 days of your liability to be registered arising. <strong>You may be liable to a financial penalty if you fail to notify at the proper time.</strong></p>

<p>You can find contact details for the VAT Registration Service:</p>

<ul>
<li>in the supplement to Notice 700/1</li>

  <li>by calling our VAT Helpline on 0300 200 3700.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who-can-be-registered">6.1.4 Who can be registered?</h4>

<p>It is the person, <strong>not</strong> the business, who is registered for VAT and each registration covers all the business activities of the <strong>registered person</strong>. The person to be registered can be, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>a sole proprietor</li>

<p>An NETP is any person who is not normally resident in the UK, and does not have a <strong>fixed or business establishment</strong> here and, in the case of a company, is not incorporated here. From 1 December 2012, <strong>NETPs who make any taxable supplies</strong> here in the UK will normally have to register and account for VAT here.</p>

<p>NETPs who make:</p>

<ul>
<li>distance sales, or</li>
  <li>acquisitions in the UK</li>
</ul>
<p>above the relevant limits, must register and account for VAT here.</p>

<p>(b) <strong>Relevant supplies</strong></p>

<p>An NETP who makes relevant supplies in the UK must register here, irrespective of the value of those relevant supplies. A <strong>relevant supply</strong> is the disposal of a capital asset by the NETP in the UK, where the NETP’s purchase of the goods (or anything incorporated in them) included UK VAT which the NETP recovered under the EC’s 8th or 13th Directive refund arrangements.</p>

<p>Notice 723A Refunds of VAT in the European Community for EC and non-EC businesses gives further information about the refund scheme.</p>

<p>(c) <strong>Disposal of capital assets</strong></p>

<p>If an unregistered UK business disposes of capital assets, and those assets were purchased from another person who had received (or any <strong>predecessor</strong> of that other person had received) a refund of UK VAT on the capital asset concerned (or anything incorporated in it) under the arrangements at (b) above, the disposal of the capital asset by the unregistered UK business is a relevant supply. The unregistered business must register and account for UK VAT on the disposal of the capital asset, irrespective of the value of that asset.</p>

<p>Further information about NETPs, relevant supplies and the meaning of business establishment and predecessor for these purposes, is in Notice 700/1 Should I be registered for VAT?</p>

<h3 id="services-from-abroad">
<span class="number">7.3 </span>6.3 Services from abroad</h3>

<p>If you receive services from abroad - see paragraph 5.4 - you must take their value into account when working out whether you must be registered. You may still have to be registered, even though you make no other types of taxable supplies or the value of your other types of taxable supplies are below the registration limits.</p>

<span class="number">7.4 </span>6.4 What should I do if I am VAT registered and make some exempt supplies?</h3>

<p>If you are a taxable person and make some exempt supplies, please read paragraph 13.1.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-have-separated-my-business-into-smaller-parts">
<span class="number">7.5 </span>6.5 What if I have separated my business into smaller parts?</h3>

<p>Where a business has been <strong>artificially</strong> separated into smaller parts and this separation results in the avoidance of VAT, we have power to direct that the persons running these activities be treated as a <strong>single taxable person</strong> and registered for VAT. For further information see the list of Statements of Practice on our website.</p>

<p>You have the right to appeal to an independent tribunal against the issue of such a direction (see Section 28).</p>

<span class="number">7.6 </span>6.6 When is it possible to register as a VAT group or have a Divisional registration?</h3>

<p>In certain circumstances a group of limited companies may apply to be treated as a single taxable person for VAT registration purposes, or a company may be allowed to register in separate divisions. For further information, see Notice 700/2 Group and divisional registrations.</p>

<h3 id="would-i-have-to-register-for-vat-if-i-am-resident-abroad">
<span class="number">7.7 </span>6.7 Would I have to register for VAT if I am resident abroad?</h3>

<p>If you are resident abroad with a business in this country making taxable supplies, distance sales or acquisitions in the UK you may have to be registered for VAT if their value is over the relevant threshold.</p>

<p>If you meet the definition of an NETP at paragraph 6.1 above, and you make taxable supplies in this country, you must register for VAT regardless of the value of those supplies.</p>

<p>If you do not make any taxable supplies in the UK, but you have an establishment here that incurs UK VAT, you may wish to apply for registration on a voluntary basis. For further information see Notice 700/1 Should I be registered for VAT?</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-register-if-i-am-part-of-a-joint-venture">
<span class="number">7.8 </span>6.8 How do I register if I am part of a joint venture?</h3>

<p>If you and some other person intend to co-operate in making taxable supplies, distance sales or acquisitions in the UK as a joint venture, this may count as a partnership which would be a new and separate person for VAT registration purposes. The joint venture may be liable to register if the value of taxable supplies and so on is above the relevant thresholds.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether the arrangements you have entered into count as a partnership for these purposes, contact the VAT Registration Service for advice.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-output-tax">
<span class="number">8.1 </span>7.1 What is output tax?</h3>

<p><strong>Output tax</strong> is the VAT that is due on your taxable supplies. It is also due in certain other circumstances.</p>

<p>This guidance explains the general rules about output tax, including the amount of tax due and tells you about some special rules for particular cases.</p>

<p>It is in three sections:</p>

<h3 id="what-is-tax-value">
<span class="number">8.2 </span>7.2 What is tax value?</h3>

<p>The <strong>tax value</strong> of a supply is the value on which VAT is due. The amount of VAT is the tax value multiplied by the tax rate.</p>

<p>The tax value of a supply depends on what you are given in exchange for the supply. This is called the <strong>consideration</strong>. A consideration is any form of payment in money or in kind, including anything which is itself a supply.</p>

<p>The consideration for a supply includes any payment that you are given to cover your costs in making the supply, unless you incur the costs as an agent (see Sections 22 to 25).</p>

<h3 id="what-if-the-consideration-is-wholly-in-money">
<span class="number">8.3 </span>7.3 What if the consideration is wholly in money?</h3>

<p>If the consideration for a supply is wholly an amount of money, the tax value is based on that amount. The amount paid includes tax. The tax is the <strong>VAT fraction</strong> of the amount and the rest of the amount is the tax value.</p>

<h4 id="vat-fractions">7.3.1 VAT fractions</h4>

<p>Tax is normally calculated at the appropriate percentage of a price that has first been decided without VAT, and the VAT invoice will show these separate amounts. However, sometimes VAT has to be calculated from a price in which it is already included (for example, in the less detailed VAT invoices described in paragraph 16.6.1). To do this, you need the VAT fraction.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>
<th><strong>If you sell something at …</strong></th>
      <th><strong>And the VAT rate is…</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Then the amount of VAT is…</strong></th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>£2.40</td>
      <td>20%</td>
      <td>£0.40</td>
    </tr></tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>However</strong>, £0.40 is not 20% of £2.40. It is 1/6 of £2.40.</p>

<p>This is how it is worked out: Rate of tax100 + rate of tax</p>

<p>So, with VAT at 20% the VAT fraction is: 20 = 1120 = 6</p>

<p>The VAT fraction varies according to the rate of tax chargeable. For example:</p>

<p><a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/public-notices/700-vat-fraction.pdf">VAT fraction example (PDF 9K)</a></p>

<p>**Note: **we will publicise the revised VAT fractions at the time of any change in rates, but you can work it out for yourself by using the method set out above.</p>

<h4 id="discounts">7.3.2 Discounts</h4>

<p>The following rules apply if you offer discounts to your customers.</p>

<p>(a) <strong>Unconditional discounts</strong></p>

      <th><strong>And…</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Then…</strong></th>

      <th><strong>Then…</strong></th>
      <th><strong>But…</strong></th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>you offer a discount on condition that the customer pays within a specified time</td>
      <td>the tax value is based on the discounted amount even if the customer does not take up your offer.</td>
      <td>if your terms allow the customer to pay by instalments, the tax value is based on the amount the customer actually pays.</td>
    </tr></tbody>

<p>(c) <strong>Contingent discounts</strong></p>

<table>

<th><strong>If…</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Then…</strong></th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>

      <td>the tax value is based on the full amount paid.</td>
    </tr></tbody>
</table>
<table><tbody><tr>
<td>If the customer later earns the discount, the tax value is then reduced and you can adjust the amount of tax by issuing a credit note (see paragraph 18.2).</td>
    </tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="what-if-the-consideration-is-not-wholly-in-money">
<span class="number">8.4 </span>7.4 What if the consideration is not wholly in money?</h3>

<p>If the consideration for a supply is not in money (as in a barter transaction - see paragraph 8.7) or the consideration is partly in money and partly something else (as in part-exchange), the tax value of the supply is the monetary equivalent of the consideration.</p>

<p>You should normally calculate this by reference to the price, excluding VAT, which a customer would have to pay for the supply if money was the only consideration.</p>

<h3 id="other-rules-about-tax-value">
<span class="number">8.5 </span>7.5 Other rules about tax value</h3>

<p>Some special rules about tax value are explained in sections 8 and 9, regarding specific transactions. See also:</p>

<h3 id="values-expressed-in-a-foreign-currency">
<span class="number">8.7 </span>7.7 Values expressed in a foreign currency</h3>

<p><strong>Paragraph 7.7 in this notice has the force of law under the VAT Act 1994, Schedule 6, Paragraph 11.</strong></p>

<p>For VAT purposes, amounts of money must always be expressed in sterling. If you need to convert an amount from a foreign currency into sterling, you must do so on the following basis:</p>

<p>(a) Unless you have adopted one of the alternatives set out below, you must use the UK market selling rate at the time of the supply. The rates published in national newspapers will be acceptable as evidence of the rates at the relevant time; or</p>

<p>(b) As an alternative, you may use the period rate of exchange published by HMRC for customs purposes. Our VAT Helpline can give you details of particular period rates. You may adopt this alternative for all your supplies or for all supplies of a particular class or description. If you opt for only a particular class or description, you should make a note of the details in your records at the time of adoption.</p>

<p>You do not need to notify us in advance if you wish to adopt this alternative, but having made such an option, you cannot then change it without first getting the agreement of the VAT Written Enquiries Team; or</p>

<p>(c) You may apply in writing to the VAT Written Enquiries Team to use a rate - or method of determining a rate - which you use for commercial purposes but which is not covered by (a) or (b) above.</p>

<p>In considering whether to allow such applications, local VAT offices will take into account:</p>

<ul>
<li>whether the proposed rate or method is determined by reference to the UK currency market</li>
  <li>whether it is objectively verifiable, and</li>
  <li>the frequency with which it is proposed to update it. Forward rates or methods deriving from forward rates are not acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Whatever rate or method you adopt, the appropriate rate for any supply is that current at the time of the supply.</strong></p>

<p>If you make supplies that fall within the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme, see Notice 709/5 Tour operators’ margin scheme for details of how to convert the value of your purchases.</p>

<h3 id="excise-duty">
<span class="number">8.8 </span>7.8 Excise duty</h3>

<p>In the case of goods subject to excise duty, the tax value is the value determined according to the principles outlined above in this section, plus the duty.</p>

<h3 id="mixed-supplies">

<p>You make mixed supplies where you charge a single inclusive price for a number of separate supplies of goods or services. This is different from a single supply of a mixture of goods or services, to which a single rate of tax applies. See paragraph 8.2 for guidance on goods and packaging and paragraph 8.3 for guidance on goods and delivery.</p>

<h4 id="apportionment">8.1.1 Apportionment</h4>

<p>There is no special method of apportionment, unless you are using the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme (TOMS), when you must use the method set out in Notice 709/5. However, your calculations must be fair and you must be able to justify them. It is usually best to use one of the methods shown in Section 32.</p>

<h4 id="when-is-apportionment-necessary">8.1.2 When is apportionment necessary?</h4>

<p>Apportionment is only necessary if the price you charge is the only consideration for the supplies (see paragraph 7.3). If the consideration for the supplies is not wholly in money, you must account for VAT as explained in paragraph 7.4.</p>

<p>You must not use apportionment if the goods and services supplied together make up a single, indivisible supply. For example, a launderette supplies a single service of washing or drying clothes, taxable at the standard rate. It cannot be treated as supplying separate goods and services, such as water, heat, or use of the machines. You should contact our VAT Helpline for advice if you have any doubt on this point.</p>

<h3 id="packaging">
<span class="number">9.2 </span>8.2 Packaging</h3>

<p>Normal and necessary packaging, including ordinary tins, bottles and jars, is treated as part of the goods which it contains. The price which your customer pays is treated as a payment for the contents of the packaging alone. This means that if your supply of the contents is zero-rated, then zero-rating also applies to the packaging.</p>

<p>But</p>

<h3 id="hire-purchase-conditional-sale-and-credit-sale">
<span class="number">9.4 </span>8.4 Hire-purchase, conditional sale and credit sale</h3>

<p><strong>Hire-purchase</strong> occurs under an agreement for the hire of goods for periodic payments, where the hirer has the option to purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Conditional sale</strong> means the sale of goods where the price is payable by instalments. The goods remain the property of the seller until the full price is paid or the customer meets another condition.</p>

<p><strong>Credit sale</strong> means the sale of goods which immediately become the property of the customer but where the price is payable by instalments.</p>

<p>These are all supplies of goods, and VAT is due on their full value at the time of supply (tax point); see Sections 14 and 15.</p>

<h4 id="supplies-not-involving-a-finance-company">8.4.1 Supplies not involving a finance company</h4>

<p>If you make an agreement to supply goods in any of the ways outlined above, without involving a finance company, which means you are self financing the credit, your charge for credit will be exempt if it is disclosed as a separate charge to your customer.</p>

<p>The consideration for the taxable supply of goods is the cash price stated in the agreement, before any deposit is paid.</p>

<p>If you supply goods on interest free credit, by arranging with your customer for them to pay for goods over a set period without charging interest, the supply of goods is taxed according to its liability. As there is no charge for credit there is no exempt supply for VAT purposes.</p>

<p>Any connected credit ancillary charges are exempt unless the contract explicitly states that the charge relates, wholly or partially, to the supply of goods. If the supply relates to the credit, normally shown as administration, documentation or acceptance fees it will be exempt.</p>

<p>Fees that relate to goods - such as option fees or fees for transfer of title - are not exempt unless the charge for them is £10 or less.</p>

<p>There is more information about the exempt supplies connected with agreements of this kind in Notice 701/49 Finance and Securities.</p>

<p>For most second-hand goods, there is a special scheme which allows you to charge tax on the difference between your buying price and your selling price, rather than on the full selling price. Use of the scheme is optional and is conditional on meeting the scheme rules about record keeping.</p>

<p>There is a simplified version of the scheme, known as Global Accounting, and a variation for use by auctioneers, called the Auctioneers’ Scheme.</p>

<p>The general conditions are that you:</p>

<ul>
<li>make no charge for them</li>
  <li>supply them for genuine business purposes as an illustrative or typical example of your product, and</li>

<h3 id="gifts">
<span class="number">9.9 </span>8.9 Gifts</h3>

<h4 id="general-1">8.9.1 General</h4>

<p>An article is a gift where the donor is not obliged to give it and the recipient is not obliged to do or give anything in return. Competition prizes are usually treated as gifts.</p>

<p>A gift of goods is normally a taxable supply and VAT is due on the cost of the goods (see paragraph 7.6). VAT is not due on certain gifts of goods (see paragraph 8.9.3 below).</p>

<p>A gift of services is not a taxable supply. But you must remember that lending someone an item from your business for use outside your business is a taxable supply (see paragraph 9.3).</p>

<h4 id="goods-and-services-supplied-as-inducements">8.9.2 Goods and services supplied as inducements</h4>

<p>You might offer someone a ‘gift’ on condition that they:</p>

<ul>
<li>buy something from you</li>
  <li>provide something for you, or</li>
  <li>perform some other action of benefit to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Goods and services supplied in these circumstances are not true gifts and VAT is due on the basis explained in paragraph 7.4. See Notice 700/7 Business promotion schemes for the special rules for this kind of supply.</p>

<h4 id="gifts-on-which-vat-is-not-due">8.9.3 Gifts on which VAT is not due</h4>

<p>VAT is not due on:</p>

<ul>
<li>any business gifts made to the same person in any 12-month period, where the total cost does not exceed £50</li>
  <li>a free meal to one of your employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>A gift of goods is zero-rated if it is given to a:</p>

<ul>
<li>charity for sale or export by it; or</li>
  <li>taxable person (such as a charity trading subsidiary) passing all the profits of sale to a charity.</li>

<h4 id="payphones">8.12.1 Payphones</h4>

<p>If you rent a payphone from British Telecom or another supplier, you make supplies to the users of the phone and VAT is due on these supplies. The VAT fraction (see paragraph 7.3.1) of the money removed is your output tax.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: With some payphone installations, it is possible to switch from payphone mode to domestic mode and make calls without inserting money. If you use the domestic mode to make non-business calls, you cannot treat all the VAT you are charged by your supplier as input tax. You will find more about what to do in Section 33.</p>

<h4 id="phonecards">8.12.2 Phonecards</h4>

<p>If you act as an agent in the sale of phonecards, you are making a standard-rated supply. You must account for VAT on the commission received from your supplier. If you use a retail scheme, you will find more about what to do in the notice for the scheme you use. See also Notice 700/7 Business Promotion Schemes.</p>

<p>If you receive supplies from government departments (including health authorities) or local authorities, you may be charged VAT.</p>

<p>If you make supplies of goods to visiting armed forces stationed in the UK, they can be relieved of VAT provided you meet certain conditions. See Notice 431 Visiting Forces or contact our VAT Helpline for advice.</p>

<p>If you dispose of goods which form part of the assets of your business - for example, you sell them, give them away or take them into private use - this is normally a supply for VAT purposes and, where it is a taxable supply, you will have to account for VAT on the disposal.</p>

<p>However, special rules apply if you sell your business as a going concern. See paragraph 26.10 for details.</p>

<p>VAT may also be due on stocks and assets on hand when you deregister. See Notice 700/11 Cancelling your registration, unless you are selling the business as a going concern (for which you should see paragraph 26.10).</p>

<h3 id="use-of-goods-or-services-in-your-business">

<p>If you use goods or services in your business, which the business itself has made or acquired, no VAT is normally due. This is because you do not make a supply.</p>

<p>However, your use of goods is treated as a <strong>taxable self-supply</strong> if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>are a motor manufacturer, vehicle converter or vehicle dealer and use a motor car in your business (see Notice 700/64 Motoring expenses)</li>
  <li>put a car on which you claimed input tax (because it was to be used as a taxi, for self drive hire or giving driving instruction) to some other use, or</li>
  <li>use your own labour to construct a building (other than dwellings or certain other residential buildings) or to increase the floor area of an existing building by 10% or more (see Notice 708 Buildings and construction).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="private-use-of-goods-including-road-fuel-and-services">
<span class="number">10.3 </span>9.3 Private use of goods, including road fuel, and services</h3>

<h4 id="goods-1">9.3.1 Goods</h4>

<p>When goods that belong to your business are put to a private use outside the business, you make a taxable supply. This includes goods that you have produced yourself, as well as goods from your stock and any other business assets.</p>

<p>Private use includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>your own personal use of business assets, and</li>
  <li>use outside the business by anyone else, such as an employee, a relative or a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some common examples of private use:</p>

<ul>
<li>you use goods owned by your business for private purposes</li>
  <li>you give or lend someone an item from your business, and</li>
  <li>your employees use goods that are assets of your business, at weekends or for holidays.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the goods are put to permanent private use, so that they are no longer business assets, the supply is one of goods. If there is no consideration for the supply, VAT is due on the cost of the supply (see paragraph 7.6).</p>

<p>If the private use is temporary, the supply is one of services. If there is no consideration for the supply, VAT is due on the cost of the supply. Over any period of time, this is the amount of depreciation on the goods <strong>plus</strong> any other standard-rated costs related to the goods <strong>multiplied</strong> by the proportion that the private use forms of the total use.</p>

<p>There are special rules for accounting for VAT on the private use of road fuel. See Notice 700/64 Motoring expenses for details.</p>

<h4 id="services-1">9.3.2 Services</h4>

<p>When services that you acquired wholly for business use are put to a private or other non-business use, you make a supply of services and must account for output tax.</p>

<p>Examples of the type of services affected are:</p>

<ul>
<li>computer software, and</li>
  <li>building construction and refurbishment, particularly to domestic premises, which are carried out for the purpose of business but whose use changes over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Not</strong> affected are continuous supplies of services, where you should normally apportion input tax between business and private or non-business use.</p>

<p>To calculate the output tax due, you may use the accounting convention you use for depreciating similar business assets, or any other fair and reasonable method of valuing the cost to you of the private or non-business use.</p>

<li>goods and services supplied to you in the UK</li>
  <li>goods you import from outside the EU</li>

<p>You can <strong>normally</strong> reclaim input tax that relates to:</p>

<ul>
<li>supplies you make which are liable at the standard rate, reduced rate or the zero rate (see Section 3)</li>
  <li>supplies you make which are outside the scope of UK VAT <strong>but</strong> which would be taxable supplies if they were made in the UK, and</li>
  <li>supplies of services you make to a person who belongs outside the EU <strong>or</strong> supplies of services you make which are directly linked to the export of goods to a place outside the EU <strong>and</strong> the making of arrangements for such supplies, <strong>provided</strong> the supply would have been exempt by virtue of any item of Group 2, or any of items 1 to 8 of Group 5, of Schedule 9 to the VAT Act 1994.</li>

  <li>on goods and services obtained before VAT registration (see Section 11)</li>

<h2 id="what-are-the-timescales-for-reclaiming-input-tax">
<span class="number">16. </span>10.5 What are the timescales for reclaiming input tax?</h2>

<p>You should normally claim input tax on the VAT return for the period during which the supplier’s tax point occurred or, for imported goods, the date of the importation. The timescales for EU acquisitions are given in Notice 725 The single market. The tax point (time of supply) will be shown on your supplier’s invoice.</p>

<p>You must also hold the associated evidence to claim deduction of input tax. If you are unable to claim input tax in the normal period because you do not hold the necessary evidence you should claim the input tax on the VAT return for the period during which you receive that evidence.</p>

<p>If you are approved to use the cash accounting scheme described in paragraph 19.3 you must also have paid for the supply. You can find full details of the scheme in Notice 731 Cash accounting.</p>

<p>If you do not claim deduction of the input tax on the return for the period in which you were first entitled to deduct it, this is an error. You cannot deduct it on a later return. If you wish to correct such error, you will need to do so in accordance with the methods explained in section 4 of Notice 700/45 How to correct VAT errors and make adjustments or claims. The time limit for claiming deduction of input tax is 4 years from the due date for the return on which you were first entitled to claim deduction of the input tax.</p>

<h2 id="what-evidence-do-i-need-to-claim-input-tax">
<span class="number">17. </span>10.6 What evidence do I need to claim input tax?</h2>

<p><strong>You must keep certain records to be able to reclaim input tax. See Section 19 for details.</strong></p>

<p>To reclaim VAT you have been charged as input tax, you must hold valid evidence that you have received a taxable supply. You can find what counts as acceptable evidence in paragraph 19.7.</p>

<h2 id="a-repayment-of-input-tax-if-you-do-not-pay-your-supplier">
<span class="number">18. </span>10.6A Repayment of input tax if you do not pay your supplier</h2>

<p>For supplies received on or after 1 January 2003 you are required to repay any input tax you have reclaimed if you have not paid your supplier within six months of:</p>

<p>(a) the date of supply (usually taken as the invoice date), or if later</p>

<p>(b) the due date for payment.</p>

<p>Notice 700/18 Relief from VAT on Bad Debts contains more detailed information on this.</p>

<h2 id="refunds-of-vat-paid-in-other-countries">
<span class="number">19. </span>10.7 Refunds of VAT paid in other countries</h2>

<p>If you buy goods or services in another Member State of the EU or in other countries, you may have to pay VAT there. This should not happen if you buy goods for export from that country, but it may apply if, for example, you take part in a trade exhibition.</p>

<p>You cannot treat the VAT of another EU Member State as input tax, but you may be able to reclaim the VAT from the authorities in that Member State if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the VAT was paid on goods or services for your business</li>
  <li>you do not make taxable supplies in the other country, and</li>
  <li>you have no place of business or other residence there.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to claim refunds of VAT or similar turnover taxes incurred in some non-EU countries.</p>

<p>VAT paid on goods and services that you received before you were registered for VAT is not input tax.</p>

<p>However, when you become registered you can treat this VAT as though it were input tax if you hold acceptable evidence (see paragraph 19.7) and can meet the conditions set out below.</p>

<p>You may only recover VAT you incurred before registration which is attributable to making taxable supplies. The partial exemption de minimis limits (see paragraph 13.1) do not apply to VAT incurred before registration.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-conditions-for-treating-vat-on-goods-as-input-tax">
<span class="number">23. </span>11.2 What are the conditions for treating VAT on goods as input tax?</h2>

<p>You can treat as input tax the VAT on goods that you obtained or imported before you were registered if:</p>

<ul>
<li>for persons that were registered or required to be registered on or before 1 April 2009, the goods were supplied not more than 4 years before the business was registered or was required to be registered</li>
  <li>for persons that were registered or required to be registered between 2 April 2009 and 31 March 2010, the goods were supplied on or before 31 March 2006</li>
  <li>for persons that were registered or required to be registered on 1 April 2010 onwards, the goods were supplied not more than 4 years before the business was registered or was required to be registered</li>
</ul>
<p>(The above conditions do not apply if the person was registered before 1 May 1997 and they have not yet made their first return.)</p>

<ul>
<li>the goods were supplied to the person who is now registered for VAT</li>
  <li>the goods were obtained for the business which is now covered by the VAT registration</li>
  <li>you still hold the goods or they have been used to make other goods which you still hold, and</li>
  <li>you compile a stock account of the goods. This must show the quantities of goods and the dates when you obtained them. If you used any goods to make other goods, or disposed of them after you were registered for VAT, the account must give details, with dates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember, you cannot claim VAT incurred on goods consumed before registration such as petrol, electricity or gas.</strong></p>

<p>If the person who is now registered is a corporate body, you may still be able to reclaim VAT from before it was incorporated. See paragraph 11.4 below.</p>

<p>If you are buying an existing business, you should also read paragraph 26.10.</p>

<p>You can treat as input tax the VAT on services which you received before you were registered if:</p>

<ul>
<li>the services were supplied to the person who is now registered for VAT</li>
  <li>the services were received for the purposes of the business which is now covered by the VAT registration and related to its taxable activities. (If the services related partly to such taxable activities and partly to other activities, you must work out what proportion of the use of the services related to the taxable activities)</li>
  <li>the services were received not more than 6 months before you were registered</li>
  <li>the services were not related to goods which you disposed of before you were registered (such as repairs to a machine which was sold before registration) and</li>
  <li>you compile an account of these services. This must describe the services and the dates when you received them. If the services related to goods which you disposed of after you were registered for VAT, the account must give details, with dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the person who is registered is a corporate body, you may still be able to reclaim VAT from before it was incorporated. See paragraph 11.4 below.</p>

<p>Where a business provides its employees with mobile phones for business use then, regardless of whether it allows private use, it can treat as input tax all the VAT it incurs on purchasing a phone and on standing charges for keeping it connected to the network providing the charges do not contain any element for calls.</p>

<h2 id="a2-vat-on-mobile-phone-call-charges">
<span class="number">31. </span>12A.2 VAT on Mobile Phone Call Charges</h2>

<h4 id="a21-business-only">12A.2.1 Business only</h4>

<p>If a business does not allow its employees to make private calls, all of the VAT incurred on the call charges is input tax. HMRC will accept this is the case where a business has imposed clear rules prohibiting private use and enforces them. However we realise that in practice businesses with such a policy often tolerate a small amount of private calls. We are prepared to treat such minimal use as being insignificant for VAT purposes and it will not prevent a business treating all the tax it incurs on calls as input tax.</p>

<h4 id="a22-charges-for-private-calls">12A.2.2 Charges for private calls</h4>

<p>If a business charges its employees for any private calls they make, then it may treat the VAT incurred on the calls as input tax, but must account for output tax on the amounts it charges.</p>

<h4 id="a23-free-private-calls">12A.2.3 Free private calls</h4>

<p>If a business allows its employees to make private calls without charge, then it must apportion the VAT incurred on the call charges. It is not appropriate for businesses to adopt an alternative treatment of accounting for output tax on the private use.</p>

<h4 id="a24-apportioning-calls">12A.2.4 Apportioning calls</h4>

<p>Businesses can choose any apportionment method that suits their individual circumstances providing the method chosen produces a fair and reasonable result. For example businesses could analyse a sample of bills taken over a reasonable period of time and use the same ratio for future VAT recovery on mobile phone bills.</p>

<h2 id="a3-fixed-monthly-charges">
<span class="number">32. </span>12A.3 Fixed monthly charges</h2>

<p>Where the phone package allows the business to make a certain quantity of calls for a fixed monthly payment and there is no separate standing charge, then it must apportion the VAT on the total charge for the package. Similarly, where the contract is for the purchase of the phone and the advance purchase of a set amount of call time for a single charge, the apportionment will also apply to the whole charge.</p>

<span class="number">33. </span>13. Input tax: partial exemption</h2>

<h2 id="exempt-supplies-and-partial-exemption">
<span class="number">34. </span>13.1 Exempt supplies and partial exemption</h2>

<p>If you incur input tax that is related to exempt supplies as well as taxable supplies, you are termed as <strong>partly exempt</strong> and you will probably not be able to claim all your input tax.</p>

<p>You must be able to relate your purchases and other expenses to the supplies that you make. Although it is relatively straightforward to work out whether goods or services have been used wholly to make either taxable or exempt supplies, you will probably have also incurred input tax on overheads that you cannot directly attribute in this way.</p>

<h4 id="apportionment-of-input-tax">13.1.1 Apportionment of input tax</h4>

<p>You will have to adopt a <strong>partial exemption method</strong> to apportion your input tax. To make this apportionment the standard method uses the relationship of the value of your taxable supplies compared to the value of your total supplies. If you do not think that this is fair and reasonable, you should contact the VAT Written Enquiries Team to seek approval to use another method.</p>

<p>For some traders, whose exempt input tax is minimal, there are rules that allow exempt input tax to be treated as taxable input tax and claimed in full.</p>

<p>You can find out more about all this in Notice 706 Partial exemption.</p>

<h2 id="capital-goods-scheme">
<span class="number">35. </span>13.2 Capital goods scheme</h2>

<p>If you use a capital item (see below) in your business, the VAT incurred on the cost of the item may be subject to adjustments under the capital goods scheme. Adjustments become necessary where there is a change in the extent to which the item is used in making taxable and exempt supplies, or where there is a change in use between business and non-business. Adjustments are required over a period of time, known as the adjustment period, which, depending on the item, can be either 5 or 10 years. Since 1 January 2011, taxpayers may also seek approval for a combined method for dealing with taxable, exempt and non-business activities.</p>

<p>Capital items include:</p>

<ul>
<li>computers and items of computer equipment with a VAT exclusive cost of £50,000 or more, and</li>
  <li>land, buildings, civil engineering works and refurbishments with a VAT exclusive cost of £250,000 or more</li>
  <li>ships, boats and other vessels, and aircraft with a VAT exclusive cost of £50,000 or more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The capital goods scheme does not apply to assets acquired, or expenditure on assets held solely for resale. These are not capital items.</p>

<p>The information on this subject is in two sections.</p>

<p>This section provides general information. It explains the rules for working out the time when a supply of goods or services is treated as taking place. This is called the <strong>tax point</strong>. The section includes information on <strong>basic</strong> and <strong>actual</strong> tax points.</p>

<p>Section 15 provides information on some specific situations.</p>

<p>You must account for VAT in the tax period in which the tax point occurs at the rate in force at that time <strong>unless</strong> you use the cash accounting scheme. Notice 731 Cash accounting tells you more about the special rules for this scheme.</p>

<p>If your supplies fall within the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme, you <strong>must</strong> follow the rules for the particular scheme you are using, even if these conflict with the tax point rules set out in this section. See Notice 709/5 Tour operators’ margin scheme for more information.</p>

<p><strong>To issue VAT invoices, you must send or give them to your customers for them to keep. A tax point cannot be created simply by preparing an invoice.</strong></p>

<h4 id="deposits">14.2.3 Deposits</h4>

<p>Most deposits serve primarily as advance payments and will create tax points under 14.2.2(a) when you receive them. But some types of deposit are not a consideration for a supply and their receipt does not create a tax point.</p>

<h2 id="continuous-supplies-of-goods-and-services">
<span class="number">39. </span>14.3 Continuous supplies of goods and services</h2>

<p>If you supply services on a continuous basis and receive payments regularly or from time to time, there is a tax point every time you:</p>

<ul>
<li>issue a VAT invoice, or</li>
  <li>receive a payment, <strong>whichever happens first</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If payments are due to be made at regular intervals (for example, by banker’s order or direct debit), you can issue a VAT invoice at the start of any period of up to one year (provided that more than one payment is due in the period) to cover all the payments due in that period.</p>

<p>For each payment you should set out the:</p>

<ul>
<li>VAT-exclusive amount</li>
  <li>date on which the payment is due</li>
  <li>rate of VAT, and</li>
  <li>VAT payable.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to do this, you do not have to account for tax on any payment until:</p>

<ul>
<li>the date on which it is due, or</li>
  <li>the date you receive it, <strong>whichever happens first</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: your customer must not reclaim, as input tax, any VAT shown on the VAT invoice until:</p>

<ul>
<li>the date on which the payment is due, or</li>
  <li>you have received the payment, whichever happens first.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same procedures apply to continuous supplies of goods, in the form of water, gas and electricity.</p>

<h2 id="goods-supplied-on-sale-or-return-approval-or-similar-terms">
<span class="number">40. </span>14.4 Goods supplied on sale or return, approval or similar terms</h2>

<p>When you supply goods on sale or return etc, they have not been sold and you still own them until such time as they are adopted by your customer. <strong>Adoption</strong> means that the customer indicates a wish to keep them. Until your customer does so, your customer has an unqualified right to return them at any time, unless you have agreed a time limit.</p>

<p>You may have fixed a time limit of adoption of less than 12 months from the date when the goods were sent.</p>

    </tr>
<tr>
<td>In either case if your customer adopts the goods before the time limit expiresthe date of adoption becomes the basic tax point.</td>
      <td> </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The basic tax point is overridden by the issue of a VAT invoice as set out in paragraph 14.2.2. If you receive a payment which is not returnable, this will normally indicate that the goods have been adopted. The payment of a deposit required as a condition of delivery – which is repayable if the goods are returned - does not constitute adoption.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to make sure that your customers notify you promptly when they have adopted goods.</p>

<h2 id="change-of-tax-rate">
<span class="number">41. </span>14.5 Change of tax rate</h2>

<h4 id="what-is-a-vat-invoice-and-when-should-i-issue-one">16.2.1 What is a VAT invoice and when should I issue one?</h4>

<p>Whenever you supply standard-rated or reduced-rated goods or services to another registered person, you must give that person a <strong>VAT invoice</strong>.</p>

<p>A VAT invoice is a document containing certain information about what you are supplying. Paragraph 16.3 sets out the information you need to show. Your customers need VAT invoices to reclaim, as input tax, the VAT you have charged them.</p>

<p>You need not issue VAT invoices for supplies to customers who are not VAT registered. In practice, this will probably mean issuing a VAT invoice to any customers who ask for one, as you will usually have no way of telling whether they are VAT registered or not. You do not have to check that a customer is VAT registered before issuing a VAT invoice.</p>

<p>If your customer pays in cash - not by cheque - you must, if asked, clearly show on the VAT invoice that payment has been received, and the date of receipt.</p>

<h4 id="exceptions">16.2.2 Exceptions</h4>

<p>You must issue a VAT invoice to a registered person unless:</p>

<ul>
<li>your customer operates self-billing arrangements (see Notice 700/62 Self-Billing) or you issue authenticated receipts (see paragraph 17.4), or</li>
  <li>you make a gift of goods on which VAT is due (see Notice 700/7 Business promotion schemes).</li>
</ul>
<p>You must not issue VAT invoices for:</p>

<p>Any goods sold under one of the VAT second-hand schemes (see paragraph 8.5). You will find details of the special invoices you have to use in Notice 718 Margin Schemes for second-hand goods, works of art, antiques and collectors’ items, or supplies that fall within the Tour Operators’ Margin Scheme.</p>

<p>In all cases other than those mentioned above, or if you have any doubt, you <strong>must</strong> apply, in writing, to the VAT Written Enquiries Team if you need an extension of the time limit. General phone enquiries may be directed to our VAT Helpline.</p>

<h4 id="must-my-invoice-be-written-in-english">16.2.4 Must my invoice be written in English?</h4>

<p>No. You may, if you wish, write your invoices in a language other than English. But you must be able to provide English translations of specific invoices within 30 days if asked to do so by a visiting officer. These rules apply to both electronic and paper invoices.</p>

<p>You must show the following details on any VAT invoice you issue::</p>

<ul>
<li>a sequential number based on one or more series which uniquely identifies the document</li>
  <li>the time of the supply (tax point)</li>
  <li>the date of issue of the document (where different to the time of supply)</li>
  <li>your name, address and VAT registration number. You may issue invoices under a trading name, but your legal name and address details must still be shown somewhere on the document</li>
  <li>the name and address of the person (customer) to whom the goods or services have been supplied;</li>
  <li>a <strong>description</strong> sufficient to identify the goods or services supplied</li>
  <li>for each <strong>description</strong>, the quantity of the goods or the extent of the services, and the rate of VAT and the amount payable, excluding VAT, expressed in any currency</li>
  <li>the gross total amount payable, excluding VAT, expressed in any currency</li>
  <li>the rate of any cash discount offered</li>
  <li>the total amount of VAT chargeable, expressed in sterling</li>
  <li>the unit price (see paragraph 16.3.2)</li>
  <li>the reason for any zero rate or exemption.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final bullet point refers to the following types of supply:</p>

<ul>
<li>supplies subject to a second-hand margin scheme</li>
  <li>supplies subject to the Tour Operators Margin Scheme (TOMS)</li>
  <li>intra-EU exempt supplies</li>
  <li>intra-EU reverse charge supplies, and</li>
  <li>intra-EU zero-rated supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the references required, please refer to VAT Information Sheet 10/07.</p>

<h4 id="unit-price">16.3.2 Unit price</h4>

<p>The requirement to include unit price on an invoice applies to countable goods or services. For services the countable element might be, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>an hourly rate</li>
  <li>or a price for standard services.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the supply cannot be broken down into countable elements, then the total tax exclusive price will be the unit price. Additionally, the ‘unit price‘ may not need to be shown at all if it:</p>

<ul>
<li>is not normally provided in a particular business sector, and</li>
  <li>is not required by the customer.</li>

<h4 id="self-billing">17.4.1 Self-billing</h4>

<p>Under a self-billing arrangement, the <strong>customer</strong> makes out VAT invoices for a VAT-registered supplier and sends a copy to the supplier with the payment. Following EU-wide changes to invoicing rules, VAT self-billed invoices must include the reference ‘SELF_BILLING’</p>

<p>If you want to use a self-billing system for supplies made by or to you, you must meet the conditions set out in Notice 700/62 Self-Billing.</p>

<h4 id="authenticated-receipts">17.4.2 Authenticated receipts</h4>

<p>You should not confuse the use of authenticated receipts with self-billing.</p>

<p><strong>Authenticated receipts</strong> are used in the construction industry in place of VAT invoices for supplies of services or of goods and services made under contracts which provide for periodic payments to be made.</p>

<p>The receipts are only valid for VAT purposes if:</p>

<ul>
<li>they contain all the information detailed in paragraph 16.3</li>
  <li>they are authenticated - that is, signed by the supplier, and</li>
  <li>no normal VAT invoice or self-billed document is issued for the supplies.</li>

<span class="number">67. </span>17.5 Calculation of VAT on invoices – rounding of amounts</h2>

<p>**Note: **The concession in this paragraph to round down amounts of VAT is designed for invoice traders and applies only where the VAT charged to customers and the VAT paid to HMRC is the same. As a general rule, the concession to round down is not appropriate to retailers, who should see paragraph 17.6.</p>

<p>You may round down the total VAT payable on all goods and services shown on a VAT invoice to a whole penny. You can ignore any fraction of a penny.</p>

<h4 id="calculation-based-on-lines-of-goods-or-services">17.5.1 Calculation based on lines of goods or services</h4>

<p>If you wish to work out the VAT separately for a line of goods or services, which are included with other goods or services in the same invoice, you should calculate the separate amounts of VAT either by rounding:</p>

<ul>
<li>down to the nearest 0.1p - for example, 86.76p would be rounded down to 86.7p, or</li>
  <li>to the nearest 1p or 0.5p - for example, 86.76p would be rounded up to 87p.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you decide, you must be consistent.</p>

<p>The final total amount of VAT payable may be rounded down to the nearest whole penny.</p>

<h4 id="calculation-based-on-tax-per-unit-or-per-article">17.5.2 Calculation based on tax per unit or per article</h4>

<p>If you want to work out the VAT per unit or per article (for example, for use in price lists), you must work out the amounts of VAT either to:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 digits after the decimal point and then round to 3 digits - for example, if the VAT is £0.0024, it should be rounded to £0.002 (0.2p), or</li>
  <li>the nearest 1p or 0.5p. If you decide to do this, you must not round the VAT down to ‘nil’ on any unit or article that is liable at the standard or reduced rate - for example, if the VAT is £0.0024, it should be rounded to £0.005 (0.5p).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="calculation-of-vat-at-retailers">
<span class="number">68. </span>17.6 Calculation of VAT at retailers</h2>

<p>Most retailers account for VAT using a retail scheme. If that is the way you account for VAT, this paragraph does not affect you.</p>

<p>Retailers are increasingly using sophisticated till technology to identify the VAT due on each transaction and issue an invoice. If you do not use a retail scheme, but instead calculate VAT at line level or invoice level, you must not round the VAT figure <strong>down</strong>. However, you may round (up and down) each VAT calculation.</p>

<h2 id="computer-invoicing">
<span class="number">69. </span>17.7 Computer invoicing</h2>

<p>Any invoice produced by your computer, either on paper, magnetic media or for direct transmission, <strong>must</strong> include all the information required for a normal VAT invoice.</p>

<p>You may be able to use a computer to:</p>

<ul>
<li>provide your customers with VAT invoices on magnetic tape or disc etc</li>
  <li>transmit VAT invoice details by electronic means direct to your customers’ computers</li>
  <li>receive VAT invoices on magnetic tape or disc etc from your suppliers, and</li>
  <li>receive VAT invoice details by electronic means from your suppliers direct to your own computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you do so, you will have to comply with certain conditions as set out in Notice 700/63 Electronic Invoicing.</p>

<p>If you do not use advanced electronic signature, or electronic data interchange (EDI) systems you may find it helpful to seek advice from our VAT Helpline as soon as you decide to use computer invoicing.</p>

<h2 id="transmission-of-invoices">
<span class="number">70. </span>17.8 Transmission of invoices</h2>

<p>If you send your VAT invoices to your customers using a fax machine or e-mail, the normal rules regarding VAT invoices apply. Invoices received in this way are acceptable as evidence for input tax deduction, subject to the normal rules.</p>

<h4 id="transmission-by-fax">17.8.1 Transmission by fax</h4>

<p>This form of transmission relies on both the supplier and the customer having fax machines.</p>

<p>There is a risk with this form of transmission - that the invoice may not be permanent if your customers have thermal-paper fax machines. More modern fax machines copy onto plain paper and these copies are as permanent as normal paper invoices. However, thermal paper copies deteriorate over time, and, as a result, your customers may be unable to fulfil their obligation to preserve their invoices for 6 years.</p>

<p>We therefore advise you to warn customers that the invoices may not be permanent if they have a thermal-paper fax machine. Preferably, this should be by a note on the VAT invoice, but it can be in any form practicable to you.</p>

<span class="number">71. </span>17.9 Using a third party to transmit invoices</h2>

<p>You may, if you wish, ‘outsource’ the physical responsibility for the issuing of your sales invoices to a third party. But you must remember that all the legal obligations relating to the contents, storage and production of the invoices raised remain with you.</p>

<ul>
<li>allow a credit or contingent discount</li>
  <li>replace returned goods</li>
  <li>deal with goods which are sold to satisfy a debt, or</li>
  <li>wish to claim relief from VAT on a bad debt.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="credits-and-contingent-discounts">
<span class="number">74. </span>18.2 Credits and contingent discounts</h2>

<h4 id="introduction-3">18.2.1 Introduction</h4>

<p>When you allow a credit or contingent discount to a customer who can reclaim all the tax on your supply as input tax, you do not have to adjust the original VAT charge <strong>provided both you and your customer agree not to do so</strong>. Otherwise, you should both adjust the original VAT charge. You should issue a credit note to your customer and keep a copy.</p>

<p>If both parties agree, the customer may issue a tax debit note instead of the supplier issuing a credit note. A valid debit note places the same legal obligations on both parties as a valid credit note and must fulfil the same conditions.</p>

<p>You will find more information in Notice 700/45 How to correct VAT errors and make adjustments or claims.</p>

<h4 id="valid-credit-or-debit-notes">18.2.2 Valid credit or debit notes</h4>

<p>To be valid for VAT purposes a credit or debit note must:</p>

<ul>
<li>reflect a genuine mistake or overcharge or an agreed reduction in the value of the supply, and be issued within one month of this being discovered or agreed</li>
  <li>give value to the customer, that is, represent a genuine entitlement (or claim) on the part of the customer for the amount overcharged either to be refunded or offset against the value of future supplies, and</li>
  <li>be headed ‘credit note’ or ‘debit note’ as appropriate and show clearly all the following details:- the identifying number and date of issue- the name, address and registration number of the supplier- the name and address of the customer- the reason for its issue - for example, ‘returned goods’- a description which identifies the goods or services for whichcredit is being claimed or allowed- the quantity and amount for each description- the total amount credited, excluding VAT- the rate and amount of VAT credited, and- the number and date of the original VAT invoice. If you cannotdo this (for example, because returned goods cannot beidentified with a particular invoice), you must be able to satisfyus by other means that you accounted for VAT on the originalsupply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Credits for zero-rated or exempt supplies included in a credit or debit note must be totalled separately and the note must show clearly that no VAT credit has been allowed for them.</p>

<p>If credit notes are issued without VAT adjustment, they should state ‘This is not a credit note for VAT’. Even if you and your customer decide not to adjust the VAT on credit notes which pass between you, you will still need to adjust your records of outputs and inputs in order to complete your VAT return. Paragraph 19.6 explains how you should record any credits allowed. If you issue invoices to persons in another Member State, credit or debit notes which amend those invoices must contain all the information required to be included on an invoice.</p>

<h4 id="tax-rates">18.2.3 Tax rates</h4>

<p>The rate of VAT to be used for a credit or debit note is the one which was in force at the time of the tax point of the original supply.</p>

<p>Section 30 tells you what to do if you have to issue a credit note because of a change in tax rate.</p>

<h4 id="accounting-for-credit-or-debit-notes-you-issue-or-receive">18.2.4 Accounting for credit or debit notes you issue or receive</h4>

<p>When you issue a credit note or receive a debit note, you must adjust:</p>

<ul>
<li>the records of the taxable supplies you have made, and</li>
  <li>your output tax for credits allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The accounts or supporting documents must make clear the nature of the adjustment and the reason for it.</p>

<p>If you have charged or claimed an incorrect amount of VAT and have already declared it on your VAT return, the remainder of this section does not apply. This is because you can only correct an error in your declaration by adopting the appropriate method of error correction detailed in section 4 of Notice 700/45 How to correct VAT errors and make adjustments or claims.</p>

<p>Where the adjustment is not in respect of an error in the amount of VAT declared on a VAT return, you should make any VAT adjustment arising from the issue or receipt of a credit or debit note in the VAT account for the period in which you enter the adjustment in your business accounts.</p>

<p>If the VAT credits you allow your customers exceed the VAT you charged on your sales in any tax period, you will have a minus figure to enter into the output tax box (Box 1) of your return. You must make it clear that it is a minus figure by:</p>

<ul>
<li>writing it in brackets if you use a paper return, or</li>
  <li>inserting a minus sign ‘-‘ before the figure if you use an electronic return. (See also paragraph 20.4.2)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bankruptcy-insolvent-liquidation-and-administrative-receivership">18.2.5 Bankruptcy, insolvent liquidation and administrative receivership</h4>

<p>The tax point for credit or debit notes issued by - or on behalf of - insolvent traders, is the date on which the supply was originally made or received.</p>

<h4 id="cancelled-registrations">18.2.6 Cancelled registrations</h4>

<p>The tax point for any credit or debit note you issue or receive after the date of cancellation of your registration is the date of the original supply. If this happens after you have already rendered your final VAT return you should contact the VAT Written Enquiries Team to arrange for any adjustments to be made.</p>

<p>We will not make any repayment where credit/debit notes do not meet the conditions for validity at paragraph 18.2.2 above.</p>

<span class="number">76. </span>18.4 Goods sold in satisfaction of a debt</h2>

<p>A supply takes place when a registered person’s business assets - including property - are sold in satisfaction of a debt. When this is a taxable supply, the proceeds of the sale are treated as tax-inclusive and tax must be accounted for as follows.</p>

<h4 id="goods-sold-by-auction">18.4.1 Goods sold by auction</h4>

<p>Within 21 days, the auctioneer must send:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tax and a statement on Form VAT 833 to the relevant team in Liverpool, and</li>
  <li>a copy of Form VAT 833 to the debtor.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get Form VAT 833 by phoning our VAT Helpline.</p>

<p>The auctioneer must also issue a VAT invoice containing the information in paragraph 16.3 but giving the name, address and VAT registration number of the supplier. The auctioneer need not be registered to issue this and should not ask the supplier for a VAT invoice.</p>

<h4 id="goods-not-sold-by-auction">18.4.2 Goods not sold by auction</h4>

<p>The seller (the person with the right to sell the goods) must account for the tax and issue the documents described in paragraph 18.4.1.</p>

<h4 id="exceptions-1">18.4.3 Exceptions</h4>

<p>This procedure does not normally apply to sales by:</p>

<ul>
<li>** Liquidators.** As the company in liquidation remains in being, although controlled by the liquidator, sales are made by the company. The company must account for the tax in the normal way.</li>
  <li>** Trustees in bankruptcy.** A bankrupt person’s property is vested in the trustee, who then carries on the business in their own right and must account for the tax in the normal way.</li>
  <li>** Administrative receivers.** An administrative receiver usually acts as the agent of the company. If so, tax is accounted for in the normal way. If the administrative receiver is <strong>not</strong> the company’s agent, the procedure at paragraph 18.4.1 must be used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-i-claim-relief-from-vat-on-bad-debts">
<span class="number">77. </span>18.5 Can I claim relief from VAT on bad debts?</h2>

<p>You may be able to claim relief from VAT on bad debts provided various conditions are met.</p>

<p>The conditions have varied over time. The present rules mean that you can claim relief on any debts which are more than 6 months old if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>paid the VAT to HMRC</li>
  <li>written off the debt in your accounts, and</li>
  <li>sent a notification to the purchaser (this condition does not apply to supplies made on or after 1 January 2003).</li>
</ul>
<p>For supplies made after 1 May 1997, claims must be made within 4 years and 6 months.</p>

<p>If you make a claim and later receive payment, you must refund the appropriate amount to us.</p>

<p>See Notice 700/18 Relief from VAT on Bad Debts for a fuller explanation and details of all the conditions that need to be met. This includes information on when relief is available on supplies made between 1 October 1978 and 26 July 1990.</p>

<p>No relief is available on supplies made before 1 October 1978.</p>

<span class="number">80. </span>19.2 What records must I keep?</h2>

<h4 id="general-requirements">19.2.1 General requirements</h4>

<p>You must keep records and accounts of all taxable goods and services which you receive or supply in the course of your business. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>standard-rated</li>
  <li>reduced-rated, and</li>
  <li>zero-rated supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also keep records of any exempt supplies that you make.</p>

<p>In addition, you must keep a summary of the totals of your input tax and output tax for each tax period. This is called a <strong>VAT account</strong> (see paragraph 19.12).</p>

<p>All these records must be kept up to date and must be in sufficient detail to allow you to calculate correctly the amount of VAT that you have to pay to, or can claim from, HMRC.</p>

<p><strong>You do not have to keep these records in any set way. But they must be kept in a way which will allow our officers to check easily the figures that you have used to fill in your VAT return. If your records do not satisfy the requirements set out in this notice, we have the power to direct you to make the necessary changes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>However you decide to keep your records, you must be able to make them readily available to our officers when they ask to see them.</strong></p>

<p>If you have more than one place of business, you must keep a list of all your branches at your principal place of business.</p>

<h4 id="for-what-operations-do-i-need-to-keep-records">19.2.2 For what operations do I need to keep records?</h4>

<p>You must keep records of all operations connected with your business which affect the amount of VAT you have to pay or can reclaim.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>every supply of goods or services you receive on which you are charged VAT by your suppliers</li>
  <li>services supplied in the UK which you receive from abroad</li>
  <li>every EU acquisition, importation or removal from warehouse</li>
  <li>all the supplies made by your business (including any zero-rated or exempt supplies)</li>
  <li>any goods you have exported (see paragraph 5.6)</li>
  <li>any gifts or loans of goods</li>
  <li>any taxable self-supplies - for example, cars, and</li>
  <li>any goods which you acquire or produce in the course of your business which you put to private or other non-business use.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must also record adjustments such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>corrections to your accounts</li>
  <li>amended VAT invoices</li>
  <li>any credits you allow or receive, and</li>
  <li>any capital item which you acquire or create for use in your business (see paragraph 13.2).</li>

<h4 id="microfilm-records">19.2.4 Microfilm records</h4>

<p>You can keep your records on microfilm or microfiche provided that copies can be easily produced and that there are adequate facilities for allowing our officers to view them when required.</p>

<p>You should get written clearance from the VAT Written Enquiries Team before any transfer to microfilm or microfiche. You may be required to operate the old and new systems side by side for a limited period of time.</p>

<p><strong>We have power to refuse or withdraw approval for the use of microfilm or microfiche if the requirements are not met.</strong></p>

<h4 id="computer-records">19.2.5 Computer records</h4>

<p>You can also keep your records on a computer, for example, on magnetic tape, disc etc, provided they can be readily converted into a satisfactory legible form and made available to us on request.</p>

<p>If you do keep your records on a computer, we can have access to it and can check its operation and the information stored. We can ask for help from you or anyone else having charge of, or who is otherwise concerned with the operation of, the computer or its software.</p>

<p>If you employ a computer bureau, you are responsible for arranging for the bureau to make your records available to us when we wish to see them. Normally this will be at your principal place of business.</p>

<p>If you decide to use a computer or the services of a computer bureau for VAT accounting, you do not need to notify HMRC of this decision, however you do have a responsibility to make sure that the records are retained for the statutory period and that they are made available when required by an officer of HMRC.</p>

<p><strong>We have power to refuse or withdraw approval for the use of computer media in any individual case if our requirements cannot be met.</strong></p>

<h4 id="audit">19.2.6 Audit</h4>

<p>Where your business is subject to an independent audit, the audit will normally cover the VAT account and other records relating to VAT. However, this does not mean that auditors must make a specific reference to the VAT records in their report.</p>

<h2 id="cash-accounting-scheme">
<span class="number">81. </span>19.3 Cash accounting scheme</h2>

<p>If the annual value of your taxable supplies (excluding VAT) is not more than £1,350,000 you may find it to your advantage to use the cash accounting scheme.</p>

<p>The scheme allows you to account for VAT on the basis of payments received and made, rather than tax invoices issued and received. It is particularly beneficial if you give your customers lengthy periods of credit or if you have a high level of bad debts.</p>

<p>You will find full details of the scheme in Notice 731 Cash accounting. If you are using the scheme, you should read this section together with the rules set out in Notice 731.</p>

<h2 id="a-flat-rate-scheme">
<span class="number">82. </span>19.3A Flat rate scheme</h2>

<h4 id="a1-what-is-the-flat-rate-scheme">19.3A.1 What is the flat rate scheme?</h4>

<p>The Flat Rate Scheme (FRS) offers small businesses an alternative to the normal transaction based method of VAT accounting. The main benefit is the time saved keeping VAT records and calculating the VAT payable to Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>

<p>When authorised to use the FRS you do not have to identify and record the VAT on your sales and purchases to calculate the VAT you owe to us. You record the VAT inclusive total of all your business supplies – including exempt supplies – and apply the flat rate percentage to it in each period. The result is the VAT you owe to us. Input tax is not normally claimed by businesses on the scheme, as an allowance for it is built into the flat rates.</p>

<h4 id="a2-who-can-join-the-scheme">19.3A.2 Who can join the scheme?</h4>

<p>The scheme is open to small businesses whose VAT exclusive annual taxable turnover does not exceed £150,000. Once on the scheme, businesses can continue to use it until their total income exceeds £230,000.</p>

<h4 id="a3-how-is-the-flat-rate-calculated">19.3A.3 How is the flat rate calculated?</h4>

<p>We calculate the flat rate percentage from the net tax paid by businesses within the different sectors and so the flat rates vary. You should choose the sector that most closely describes your main business activity.</p>

<h4 id="a4-advantages-and-disadvantages">19.3A.4 Advantages and disadvantages</h4>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>no need to separate out gross, VAT and net in your accounts</li>
  <li>if you are in your first year of VAT registration you can reduce your flat rate by 1%, until the day before the first anniversary of you becoming VAT registered</li>
  <li>you always know how much of your takings will need to be paid in VAT</li>
  <li>less chance of mistakes, so fewer worries</li>
  <li>less work doing the books so you can get on with running your business, and</li>
  <li>can be used in conjunction with the annual accounting scheme and has its own version of cash accounting and retail schemes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>you cannot claim input tax, so you could lose out if you regularly receive a VAT repayment under normal VAT accounting</li>
  <li>the lesser detail of VAT records kept while using the scheme may make it more difficult to monitor whether the scheme is still a help to the business, and</li>
  <li>because the flat rates are averages, you may pay more VAT under the scheme than you would under normal VAT accounting.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find further details about the flat rate scheme, including the table of flat rates and an application form, in Notice 733 Flat rate scheme for small businesses.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-copies-of-vat-invoices">
<span class="number">83. </span>19.4 Keeping copies of VAT invoices</h2>

<p>Unless you make retail supplies and issue less detailed VAT invoices (see paragraph 16.6.1) you <strong>must</strong> keep a copy of all VAT invoices that you issue.</p>

<p>If you are a cash and carry wholesaler (see paragraph 17.2) you <strong>must</strong> keep a copy of all till rolls and product code lists.</p>

<h2 id="recording-supplies-you-make-and-working-out-your-output-tax">
<span class="number">84. </span>19.5 Recording supplies you make and working out your output tax</h2>

<h4 id="general-4">19.5.1 General</h4>

<p><strong>Note: **This sub-paragraph does not apply to supplies that are dealt with under a retail scheme</strong>.**</p>

<p>You must keep a record of all the supplies that you make in the course of your business. This includes any zero-rated or exempt supplies.</p>

<p>This record must contain all the information that must be shown on VAT invoices (see paragraph 16.3). If you issue invoices which give all the necessary details then, as long as you keep copies, you will only need to prepare a summary of your invoices.</p>

<p>This should be in the same order as your copy invoices and should allow you to produce separate totals for each tax period of the:</p>

<p>(a) amount of VAT chargeable on your supplies. If you have to make an adjustment for credits you have allowed your customers (see paragraph 18.2), you should deduct the VAT on these credits from the amount of <strong>VAT PAYABLE</strong> in your VAT account (see paragraph 19.12);</p>

<p>(b) VAT-exclusive value of your standard-rated, reduced-rated and zero-rated supplies</p>

<p>(c) value of any exempt supplies you have made, and</p>

<p>(d) amount of VAT due on any:</p>

<ul>
<li>goods you import by post - other than by Datapost - with a value of £2000 or less (see also paragraph 19.8.1 (b)), and</li>
  <li>services supplied in the UK which you receive from abroad.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should carry this amount forward to the VAT PAYABLE side of your VAT account (see paragraph 19.12).</p>

<p>Under (b) and (c) you should not make any deduction for cash discounts but you should deduct any credits you have allowed in the tax period.</p>

<p>You must also keep a record of:</p>

<ul>
<li>credits allowed to your customers for all supplies that you make (see paragraph 19.6)</li>
  <li>goods you send out on sale or return, approval or similar terms, showing their respective tax points (see paragraph 14.4), and</li>
  <li>special transactions you are involved in as described in paragraph 19.5.2 and paragraph 19.5.3 below.</li>

<ul>
<li>date that the goods were given away, taken, or set aside for non-business use</li>

<span class="number">86. </span>19.7 Evidence of input tax</h2>

<h4 id="general-5">19.7.1 General</h4>

<p>You must keep all invoices for standard-rated, reduced-rated and zero-rated supplies that you receive for your business. They must be kept in such a way that, given the invoice date and the supplier’s name, they can be easily produced to us.</p>

<p>You cannot use an invoice which is marked ‘pro-forma’ or ‘THIS IS NOT A TAX INVOICE’ as evidence for reclaiming input tax (see paragraph 17.3).</p>

<p>Only a registered person can issue a VAT invoice. There are financial penalties for the unauthorised issue of VAT invoices. If you receive an invoice from an unregistered person and knowingly use it to reclaim VAT, you are committing an offence.</p>

<p>You should have no problem finding out from your suppliers whether they are registered. If you are in any doubt or you are unsure about the validity of a supplier’s VAT invoice, you should phone our VAT Helpline.</p>

<p>In your own interest, you should obtain and retain VAT invoices. Without them, you may not be able to reclaim VAT you have been charged.</p>

<h4 id="purchases-from-cash-and-carry-wholesalers">19.7.2 Purchases from cash and carry wholesalers</h4>

<p>If you buy goods from a cash and carry wholesaler you will need VAT invoices to support your claims for input tax.</p>

<p>If the cash and carry wholesaler provides VAT invoices in the form of till rolls and the goods are represented only by product code numbers (see paragraph 17.2), you must get an up to date copy of the wholesaler’s product code list and keep it with the till roll invoices, so that both are readily available for inspection when required.</p>

<h4 id="imported-goods-and-goods-removed-from-warehouse">19.7.3 Imported goods and goods removed from warehouse</h4>

<p>You or your agent should make sure that official evidence is obtained, where required, of VAT chargeable on imported goods and goods removed from warehouse. See Notice 702 Imports.</p>

<p>This evidence serves the same purpose as a VAT invoice from a registered UK supplier. Without it you may not be able to reclaim tax you have been charged.</p>

<p>The evidence should be annexed or cross-referenced to the relevant invoice from your supplier and <strong>both</strong> should be retained. For goods acquired from a VAT registered person in another EU member state, you should hold the relevant invoice from the person supplying the goods.</p>

<h4 id="services-received-from-abroad">19.7.4 Services received from abroad</h4>

<p>If you receive from abroad a supply of any services which are supplied in the UK, you should hold the relevant invoice from the person supplying the services.</p>

<h4 id="other-circumstances">19.7.5 Other circumstances</h4>

<p>If you are treating as input tax the VAT on goods or services supplied to you:</p>

<p>(a) the invoice can be made out to an employee for subsistence expenses mentioned in paragraph 12.1 and for petrol (see Notice 700/64 Motoring expenses); and</p>

<p>(b) you do not need a VAT invoice for some types of supply if your total expenditure for each taxable supply was £25 or less (including VAT). You must be sure that the supplier was registered for VAT. If in doubt, check with our VAT Helpline. This applies to:</p>

<ul>
<li>phone calls from public or private phones</li>
  <li>purchases through coin-operated machines</li>
  <li>car-park charges (on-street parking meters are not subject to VAT), and</li>
  <li>a single or return toll charge paid at the tollbooth. However, you need to obtain a VAT invoice, irrespective of the price of each individual toll if:i) You purchase a book of toll tickets, orii) You use a tolled road, bridge or crossing under an arrangement where you pay in advance for your journeys, or you are invoiced in arrears for your journeys, or a combination of the two (for example, if you use an electronic tag or if you are an account customer)<strong>This excludes tolls charged by the:</strong>Cleddau BridgeClifton Suspension BridgeDartford BridgeErskine BridgeForth Road BridgeHumber BridgeItchen BridgeMersey TunnelTamar BridgeTay BridgeTyne Tunnel.</li>

<p>The summary must allow you to produce separate totals for each tax period of the amount of VAT:</p>

<p>(a) you have been charged on goods and services you have received - including VAT paid or deferred at import or on removal from warehouse. If you have to make an adjustment for credits received from suppliers in the tax period (see paragraph 18.2), you should deduct VAT on these credits;</p>

<p>(b) due on:</p>

<ul>
<li>goods imported by post - other than by Datapost - with a value of £2,000 or less (see also paragraph 19.5.1 (d)); or</li>
  <li>any services which you receive from abroad which are supplied in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tax can be reclaimed as input tax subject to the normal rules. You should carry forward the total amount of deductible input tax ((a) plus (b)) less any non-deductible items - see paragraph 19.8.2 below) to the VAT DEDUCTIBLE side of your VAT account (see paragraph 19.12).</p>

<p>(c) The VAT-exclusive value of all supplies you have received. This includes goods you have imported or removed from warehouse and any of the services which you have received from abroad which are supplied in the UK. You should not make any deduction for cash discounts but you should deduct all credits you received from suppliers in the tax period.</p>

<p>For example, an add-list would be acceptable as a summary if it shows tax and values separately itemised in the order in which you keep the VAT invoices. Alternatively, you may find the method described in sub-paragraph 19.8.3 more suitable.</p>

<p><strong>However you keep your records they must show the above totals.</strong></p>

<p>You must also keep a record of:</p>

<ul>
<li>credits received from suppliers for all taxable supplies you receive (see paragraph 19.9), and</li>
  <li>supplies you receive for your business on which VAT is not deductible (see paragraph 19.8.2 below).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are partly exempt (see paragraph 13.1) you should look at Notice 706 Partial exemption. If you acquire or create a capital item for use in your business (see paragraph 13.2), you should also look at Notice 706/2 Capital goods scheme. This will tell you what records you need to keep in case a capital goods scheme adjustment becomes necessary.</p>

<h4 id="non-deductible-items">19.8.2 Non-deductible items</h4>

<p>As explained in paragraph 10.3, you cannot reclaim the tax you have been charged on certain supplies that you receive for your business. You must keep a record of any such supplies that you receive. You must not include VAT that you are charged on these items in the total carried to your VAT account.</p>

<h4 id="cashbook-accounting">19.8.3 Cashbook accounting</h4>

<p>If it is your normal accounting practice to claim input tax according to the time when you pay your suppliers, you may find it convenient to adapt your cashbook payments record to serve also as a record of the taxable supplies you receive - for example, by including an extra ‘tax’ column.</p>

<p><strong>If you change to this method from another method of accounting, you must exclude any VAT which you have already claimed on a previous return.</strong></p>

<p>If you use a retail scheme, your cashbook figures can also be used to work out the value of the goods you receive for resale <strong>provided</strong> you:</p>

<ul>
<li>subtract amounts you owe suppliers at the beginning of a tax period, and</li>
  <li>add on amounts you owe suppliers at the end of the tax period.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="record-of-credits-received-from-suppliers">
<span class="number">88. </span>19.9 Record of credits received from suppliers</h2>

<p>You must keep a record of all credits you receive from your suppliers for any <strong>taxable</strong> supplies that you receive. This includes standard-rated, reduced-rated and zero-rated supplies.</p>

    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the VAT credits you receive from your suppliers exceed the VAT you were charged on your purchases in any period, you will have a minus figure to enter in the input tax box (Box 4) of your VAT return. You must make it clear that it is a minus figure by:</p>

<ul>
<li>writing it in <strong>brackets</strong> if you use a paper return, or</li>
  <li>inserting a <strong>minus sign</strong> ‘-’ before the figure if you use an electronic return. (See also paragraph 20.4.2)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Debit notes</strong></p>

<p>If you normally issue debit notes to suppliers from whom credit is due and adjust your commercial records at that stage, you can adjust your input tax records as well.</p>

<p>The debit notes must show similar details to those required for credit notes. If you later receive credit notes from your suppliers, they should be compared with the debit notes and any errors corrected. If you do this, you must make sure that adjustments are made once only, and that the debit and credit notes are not both used as accounting documents.</p>

<p>If you can reclaim all the tax on the supply as input tax and issue a debit note, you do not have to adjust the original VAT charged to you, as long as the supplier agrees that you need not do so. However, if either you or the supplier wishes to adjust the original VAT charge, both of you must do so.</p>

<p>If you correct an error in the amount of VAT chargeable with your customer (for example, by issuing a credit note or supplementary invoice to the customer), the correction should be allowed to work through your accounting system. It should then be reflected in an adjusted total of output tax due from you, at the end of the tax period in which the error was corrected.</p>

<p>If you issue a credit note or supplementary invoice to correct an error in a VAT invoice, it should bear a reference to the number and date of that VAT invoice and show clearly both the correct and incorrect amounts of VAT.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-correct-errors-i-find-on-previous-vat-returns">
<span class="number">90. </span>19.11 How do I correct errors I find on previous VAT returns?</h2>

<p>Generally, you can only correct errors in accounting periods ending in the last 4 years. Please see sections 4 and 6 of Notice 700/45 How to correct VAT errors and make adjustments or claims for more information about time limits.</p>

<p>There are two ways of correcting errors you find on previous VAT returns. Before you decide which way to use, you should read Notice 700/45: ‘How to correct VAT errors and make adjustments or claims’.</p>

<p>You can adjust your VAT account and include the value of that adjustment on your current VAT return but you can only correct the errors this way if they were not deliberate and:</p>

<ul>
<li>the net value of errors found on previous returns does not exceed £10,000, or</li>
  <li>the net value of errors found on previous returns is between £10,000 and £50,000 but <strong>does not exceed</strong> 1% of the box 6 (net outputs) VAT return declaration due for the return period in which the errors are discovered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see paragraph 4.3 of Notice 700/45 for detailed information on how to work out the net value of errors.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Use Form VAT 652: Notification of Errors in VAT Returns to inform HMRC of the errors, but do not make an adjustment on a later VAT return. You must use this method if the error was deliberate. Send the Form VAT 652 to the address shown in section 4.11 of Notice 700/45.</p>

<p>Interest and Penalties</p>

<p>We may charge interest in certain circumstances. We may also charge you a penalty. The type of penalty will depend on the accounting period(s) that are in error. These penalties are: ‘Misdeclaration penalty’ and ‘Penalties for inaccuracies’. For more information about default interest and misdeclaration penalty, please see section 27. For more information about Penalties for inaccuracies, please see paragraph 4.1 of Notice 700/45.</p>

<h2 id="vat-account">
<span class="number">91. </span>19.12 VAT account</h2>

<h4 id="what-is-a-vat-account">19.12.1 What is a VAT account?</h4>

<p>For each tax period you must keep a summary of the totals of your output tax and input tax. This is called your <strong>VAT account</strong>.</p>

<p>You should keep it in a special book or ledger opening. You will find an example of a simple VAT account at paragraph 19.14, but any form of account containing the same information will be acceptable to us. If you are in doubt, ask our VAT Helpline for advice.</p>

<h4 id="making-up-your-vat-account">19.12.2 Making up your VAT account</h4>

<p>You make up your VAT account by adding up the VAT in your records at convenient intervals - for example, once a month - and putting the totals in your VAT account with separate headings for VAT deductible and VAT payable.</p>

<p>Under <strong>VAT DEDUCTIBLE</strong>, you should itemise separately:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>

    </tr>
<tr>
<td>Any relief allowed from VAT on bad debts.</td>
      <td>18.5</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You should sub-total these entries, then subtract from that sub-total the amount of VAT you have been allowed on credits from your suppliers during the period. The result will be the total VAT deductible for the period.</p>

<p>Under <strong>VAT PAYABLE</strong>, you should itemise separately:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr>

<p>You should sub-total these entries, then subtract from that sub-total the amount of VAT you have allowed on credits to your customers during the period. The result will be the total VAT payable for the period.</p>

<p><strong>Calculations</strong></p>

<p>Add up separately the <strong>VAT DEDUCTIBLE</strong> and the <strong>VAT PAYABLE</strong>, take the smaller amount from the larger and record the difference.</p>

<p>If your calculations result in negative figures, you should show this in the appropriate box on your VAT return. You must make it clear by:</p>

<ul>
<li>writing the figure <strong>in brackets</strong> if you use a paper return, or</li>
  <li>inserting a <strong>minus sign</strong> ‘-’ before the figure if you use an electronic return. (See also paragraph 20.4.2.)</li>

<h4 id="tax-adjustments">19.12.3 Tax adjustments</h4>

<p>Tax adjustments for previous periods that <strong>we have notified to you in writing</strong> must not be shown in your VAT returns.</p>

<p>These adjustments should not appear in your VAT account unless it forms an integral part of your commercial accounting system. If we notify a tax adjustment to you, we will, at the same time, provide you with the necessary accounting information.</p>

<h2 id="claims-where-a-declaration-or-assessment-has-included-too-much-output-tax">
<span class="number">92. </span>19.13 Claims where a declaration or assessment has included too much output tax</h2>

<p>If you have overdeclared output VAT or we have included too much output VAT in an assessment, you can make a claim for a credit.</p>

<p>There is a 4-year time limit on making a claim. The relevant date from which this time limit starts will depend on the circumstances giving rise to the claim.</p>

<p>HMRC will not credit or repay any amount where to do so would result in your unjust enrichment - For example, where you passed the tax on to your customers but are unwilling, or unable, to pass on to them the benefit of the repayment.</p>

<p>You can ask our Helpline if you are not sure if you are entitled to a claim. If you are not happy with our decision you can ask for a review by an independent officer or appeal to the VAT and Duties Tribunal (see paragraph 28.4).</p>

<p>Information on methods of error correction, how to make a claim, time limits and unjust enrichment can be found in Notice 700/45 How to correct VAT errors and make adjustments or claims.</p>

<p>Since 1 April 2010 all VAT-registered businesses with a VAT exclusive turnover of £100,000 or more, plus any newly registered businesses (regardless of turnover), must submit their returns online and pay electronically. From 1 April 2012, this requirement is extended to virtually all VAT-registered businesses.</p>

<p>You (or your accountant or other agent) can submit your VAT return online by using either the free HMRC VAT Online service or commercial software<strong>.</strong> Submitting your VAT return online offers a range of benefits including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed - if you’re not already registered to use HMRC Online Services, going through the online registration and enrolment process (which you only need to do once) takes just a few minutes. You’ll be able to submit your return as soon as you’ve registered and enrolled for VAT services.</li>
  <li>Security - all transactions are 100 per cent secure, since they’re encrypted to the highest commercial standards. You get a unique User ID and create a password to keep your details safe. This allows only you - or someone you authorise - to have access to that information.</li>
  <li>Convenience - the online service is available day and night, whenever is best for you.</li>
  <li>Accuracy - there are automatic checks to help reduce errors; meaning there’s less chance of having your return sent back to you to be corrected or for clarification.</li>
  <li>Reliability - you don’t have to worry about your return being lost or delayed in the post as you’ll get an on-screen acknowledgment - including a unique submission receipt reference number - when you submit your return.</li>
</ul>
<p>To enrol for this service go to <a rel="external" href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/VAT/index.htm">hmrc.gov.uk/VAT/index.htm</a>.</p>

<p>When you enrol for the VAT Online service, you can arrange to receive free email reminders - HMRC <strong>strongly recommends</strong> that you do. You will need to provide an email address which HMRC will use to remind you when your VAT return is due.</p>

<p>If you submit your return online, you <strong>must</strong> pay any VAT due in full by an approved electronic method. You must allow enough time for the electronic payment to clear to our bank account. Please see paragraph 21.3.1</p>

<p>The period covered by the return is called a <strong>tax period</strong> (but on formal documents it may be referred to as a ‘prescribed accounting period’).</p>

<p>The standard tax period is 3 months. To spread the flow of returns evenly over the year, you will have been allocated to one of 3 groups of tax periods when you were registered.</p>

<table>

<th><strong>Group</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Tax periods end on the last days of…</strong></th>

<p>You can apply to have the tax periods which fit in with your financial year. If the transfer of a going concern results in a new registration, you can apply to retain the tax periods of the previous registration. This also applies if a change in the circumstances of a registered business makes a new registration necessary (see paragraph 26.2).</p>

<p>You should send your application to the VAT Registration Service (for contact details see paragraph 6.1.3) quoting your VAT registration number and the dates of your financial year.</p>

<h4 id="monthly-tax-periods">20.5.2 Monthly tax periods</h4>

<p>You can ask for monthly tax periods if you normally expect to receive repayments. Remember, if you do have monthly tax periods, you will have to make twelve returns a year instead of four. You cannot have monthly tax periods if your registration is voluntary.</p>

<p>If you have monthly tax periods and you change from receiving repayments to making payments, you may have to change to the standard 3 month tax periods.</p>

<h4 id="non-standard-tax-periods">20.5.3 Non-standard tax periods</h4>

<p>If your accounting system is not based on calendar months, you can apply in writing to the VAT Registration Service to have tax periods which fit your system more closely (for contact details see paragraph 6.1.3).</p>

<p>If you have been given approval to use special tax periods, we will send you a new VAT registration certificate. Your VAT returns will show the dates of the approved special periods.</p>

<p>Whatever your tax periods, you must not alter the dates shown on the return.</p>

<h2 id="annual-accounting-scheme">
<span class="number">100. </span>20.6 Annual accounting scheme</h2>

<h4 id="eligibility">20.6.1 Eligibility</h4>

<p>This scheme allows eligible businesses to submit one VAT return a year instead of the usual four. You will have to make interim payments by electronic means based on your actual or estimated annual VAT liability.</p>

<p>The scheme is open to businesses who expect to have taxable supplies of up to £1,350,000.</p>

<h4 id="interim-payments">20.6.2 Interim payments</h4>

<p><strong>Monthly</strong></p>

<p>The normal pattern is to pay nine installments, which are calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have been registered for 12 months or more you will make 9 interim payments of 10% of your previous year’s VAT liability.</li>
  <li>If you have been registered for less than 12 months you will make 9 interim payments of 10% of your expected VAT liability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quarterly</strong></p>

<p>If it better suits your business needs, you can apply to make three quarterly instalments. These are calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have been registered for 12 months or more, each quarterly instalment will be 25% of your previous year’s VAT liability.</li>
  <li>If you have been registered for less than 12 months, each quarterly instalment will be 25% of your expected VAT liability.</li>
  <li>payment pattern you use, you have 2 months following the end of your annual accounting year to send in your return and balancing payment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="advantages-of-the-scheme">20.6.3 Advantages of the scheme</h4>

<p>The main advantages of the scheme are:</p>

<ul>
<li>it helps you smooth out your cash flow by paying a set amount each month, or quarter</li>
  <li>you can make additional payments as and when you can afford to</li>
  <li>you only need to fill in one VAT return each year, instead of four</li>
  <li>you get two months to submit your annual VAT return and balancing payment, instead of one, and</li>
  <li>you can align your VAT year with the end of your business tax year, to simplify your end of year routines.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="points-to-consider">20.6.4 Points to consider</h4>

<p>You will also need to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repayment traders will not have to make interim payments but will not get a repayment until the annual return is sent in.</li>
  <li>You must continue to keep your business records on a regular basis, do not try to write them all up at the end of the year.</li>
</ul>
