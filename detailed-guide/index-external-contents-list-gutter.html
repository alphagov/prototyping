  <p>If you're acting on behalf of a Child Benefit client and want to discuss specific details of their case with the Child Benefit Office, you'll need to get your client's authorisation before you start. You don't need to be authorised if you only want to give <a href="https://www.gov.uk//child-benefit">general advice</a>.</p>
  <p>Unless you have been authorised to act as an appointee, you will not be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-child-benefit-behalf-someone-else">get Child Benefit payments</a></li>
    <li>get any award or decision notices</li>
    <li>stop or restart payments if your client or their partner has to pay the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge [/child-benefit-tax-charge].</li>
  </ul>

    How to get authorisation
  </h2>
  <p>To get authorisation your client should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/claim-child-benefit-behalf-someone-else/authorisation">complete form TC689 'Authority for an intermediary to act on your behalf'</a></li>
    <li>ask you to complete the intermediary's details section</li>
    <li>send it to the Tax Credit Office, who will then send on to the Child Benefit Office.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Authorisation usually lasts for 12 months from the date your client signed the TC689. But it can be earlier or later if they have entered a different end date on the form.</p>
  <p>If you're dealing with a large number of Child Benefit queries you can register as an intermediary organisation. This will enable the Child Benefit Office to deal more quickly with your queries.</p>
  <p>To register you need to write to:</p>
   <div class="address">
    <div class="adr org fn">
      <p>
       HMRC Tax Credits
       <br>Intermediaries
       <br>Agents and Appointees Team 
       <br>PRESTON 
       <br>PR1 4AT
       <br>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If you need authorisation urgently, and you have your client's completed form TC689, you can make your request online. To do this your organisation must have registered as an intermediary organisation. You'll also need your organisation's Office Identification Number (OIN).</p>
  <p>If you use the online form you must keep hold of your client's completed form TC689 for seven years from the date it was signed. The Tax Credit Office could ask to see it at any time.</p>

  <h2 id="before-youre-authorised">
    <span class="number">2.</span>
    Before you're authorised
  </h2>
  <p>Until you're authorised, your client will need to deal directly with the Child Benefit Office. If you call the Child Benefit Helpline in the meantime, your client will need to be with you.</p>
  <p>At the start of the call your client will need to answer a number of security questions and will be asked to confirm that they want you to act on their behalf. The authorisation applies only to that phone call. If your client is not with you, you'll only be able to get general advice.</p>
  <p>The Child Benefit Helpline can arrange advice through an interpreter if your client's first language isn't English. Your client can use their own interpreter but you, the client and their interpreter must be present when you call.</p>
  <h2 id="calling-the-child-benefit-helpline">
    <span class="number">3.</span>
    Calling the Child Benefit Helpline
  </h2>
  <p>When you call the Child Benefit Helpline you'll need to be able to answer security questions about your client and about yourself. You can also provide your client's Child Benefit number, or National Insurance number, if they have one.</p>
